# Disregard for psychological weakness

> In our advice to the Acropolitans, we often reaffirm much the need for a determined march, an unwavering will, the value of magic symbols and standards. But we forget that our people, for the most part, also need a little affection, attention even if it is their little ones to learn to overcome them, to listen to their folly so that they can see them and to overcome the annoying barriers. I want my National MM to realize that they are not driving the "chosen race," because there are no chosen races. They're only driving a few Sixth Subraza seeds, often mixed with quantities of manure... but manure is fertilizer and seeds need it. So, instead of looking gross, learn to rotate the Earth of Life.

> The Acropolitan must know how to silence his Kama- manas and clean himself from those feminoid elements (in the worst sense of the word) that precipitate him into the arms of subconscious animality; of the spirit of escape, of turning his back on life and of being kidnapped by the Dark Forces. You must avoid that kind of psychic rape so that they are not born, then, within your astral and mental body, the elemental larvae that will resound the Soul.

> In a sensitive spirit, the disease of his Astral Body makes him sensitive, and in the midst of the fierce battle we fought against the Dark Forces, it is porcelain already slashed inside and outside, which hampers the feet of those who work and makes them move with great care so as not to pluck the fragile psychological structure of the affected. He constantly asks for affection and understanding, but he does not give those around him the same thing he asks, or he does so by excessive impulses that are born of his instinct strongly developed by this form of invisible plague. In constant imbalance, he believes that others have a moral obligation to take care of him and keep him up, never worrying about strengthening his own psychic legs.
