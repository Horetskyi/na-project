# Contempt for psychological weakness

> In our counsel to the acropolitans, we often strongly reaffirm the need for a determined march, an unbreakable will, the value of magical symbols and standards. But we forget that our people, for the most part, also need a little affection, some attention even to their little faults so that they learn to overcome them, that they hear their follies so that, as such, they see them and can overcome annoying barriers. I want my National MMs to realize that they are not leading the "chosen race", for there are no chosen races. They are only leading a few seeds of the Sixth Subrace, often mixed with quantities of manure… but manure is fertilizer and the seeds need it. So, instead of making a face of disgust, learn to till the Earth of Life.

> The acropolitan must know how to silence his Kama-manas and cleanse himself of those feminoid elements (in the worst sense of the word) that plunge him into the arms of subconscious animality; of the spirit of flight, of turning his back on life and of allowing himself to be seized by the Dark Forces. He must avoid that kind of psychic violation so that elemental larvae do not later arise within his astral and mental body and desiccate his Soul.

> Of sensitive spirit, the disease of his Astral Body makes him overly sentimental, and in the midst of the fierce battle we wage against the Dark Forces, he is porcelain already cracked inside and out, which hinders the feet of those who work and makes them move with extreme care so as not to brush against the affected one's fragile psychological structure. He constantly asks for affection and understanding, but he does not give to those around him what he asks for, or he does so by exaggerated impulses born of his instinct, strongly developed by this form of invisible plague. In constant imbalance, he believes that others have the moral obligation to care for him and keep him upright, never worrying about strengthening his own psychic legs.
