# Homophobia in New Acropolis

> The Hachado should have, if he is a gentleman, a virile presence, and if she is a lady, a feminine presence. The opposite is against Nature and links us with the underworld of homosexuals and lesbians.

> A couple of years ago I published, from these very pages, my ideas about the need to protect New Acropolis from a threat that was becoming increasingly dangerous: homosexuality and drug addiction.

> Homosexuality and drug addiction are not a disease nor a necessity, but a mortal vice that every natural and decent person is obliged to combat.

> (...) where fragile little ladies pull on rustic jeans and riding boots... even to give a piano concert. And where men take to makeup, silky massages, "unisex" shirts and sway when dancing as if they were Hawaiian dancers, while they fear holding a gun in their hand and do not even know how to use a hammer. All this has caused the chaos in which we have to live, with its aftermath of drug addicts, drunkards, homosexuals and cowardly selfishness.

> In our Movement we do not ask you to be a moralist; but try to be as moral as possible. Do not set a bad example for anyone and do not mire your Soul in the muds of corruption. Keep away from drugs, from homosexuals, from thieves, from the violent, from cowards, from idlers, from petty politicians, from fanatics.
