# Homophobia in New Acropolis

> Have the Hachado, if it's a gentleman, a manly presence, and if it's a lady, a female presence. The opposite is against nature and we are related to the subworld of homosexuals and lesbians.

> A couple of years ago I published, from these very pages, my ideas about the need to protect New Acropolis from a threat that was becoming increasingly dangerous: homosexuality and drug addiction.

> Homosexuality and drug addiction is not a disease or a necessity, but a mortal vice that every natural and decent person is obliged to fight.

> The behavior becomes multivalent; everything is good and has its justification. The inverts and lesbians proclaim their condition with large banners on the streets of the main Capitals of the Planet, and the criminals locked in the prisons are called "marginalized."

> Theft, lie, immoral customs (drug addiction, alcoholism, homosexuality, prostitution, gambling, and many other often pointed out) do not fit our ranks. Our means must be in accordance with our purposes and principles.

> (...) where fragile ladies find rustic jeans and riding boots... even to give a piano concert. And where men like afeites, the silky massages, the "unisex" shirts and they get into it when they dance like Hawaiian danzarines, while they fear having a gun in their hands and they don't even know how to handle a hammer. All this has caused the chaos in which we have to live, with its sequelae of drugs, beoduses, homosexuals and selfishness cowards.

> In our Movement we do not ask you to be a moralist; but try to be as moral as possible. Don't give anyone a bad example and don't focus your Soul on the sludge of corruption. Get away from drugs, homosexuals, thieves, violent, cowards, haragans, politicians, fanatics.
