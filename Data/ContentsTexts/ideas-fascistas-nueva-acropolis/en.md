# Fascist ideas of New Acropolis

Here are some quotes from the Bastions, Mands and Almenas. Let us remember that these texts are not the only ones where Livraga presented his ideas. Moreover, in these texts he tried to "watch" his ideology so as not to scare the members.

> There are not few who begin to criticize all the work of New Acropolis and its middle commands, or leave our Movement to give themselves to the pseudo-orientalist currents so in bogue, of pans sound on the corners and of languid incissos lit by teenagers of dirty body and confused soul, who cover their abandoned with the name of some fashionable Guru. And still some fall directly into the claws of atheist communism.

> In the Decrees of the Buenos Aires RIMM, in 1975, the Acropolitan Salute was officialized, recommending that the upper arm should have a 45 degree relationship to the upper vertical of the body. This was already done since the foundation of the Movement and its origin was attributed to historical motivations linked to the Roman Empire. The word "AVE" ("Sacred," in Latin), which accompanies the physical greeting, highlighted the latter.

> We welcome with optimism these new currents of thought and action, as they are darts that are being nailed into the flanks of dialectical materialism and those of multitudinary liberalism, the two great "Dragons" of our twentieth century against which must rise the banner of their ideal all Acropolis.

> Racism is much more dangerous and multifaceted than it seems; it is not deprived of Nazi Germany with its concentration camps, but it extends to the "Israeli Commands" who are still engaged in hunting for the elderly who belonged to the National Socialist Party.
> 
> It is obvious that a complex of collective inferiority is often an engine of exclusivity. The best known example is that of the ancient Israelites, who feel uprooted in the midst of the great centers of invention of the powerful civilizations that contained them, develop the dangerous doctrine of being "elected from God" and attack any form of faith other than their own, passing from aggressors to victims of a whole historical process of mutual persecution. Insults and offenses to Egyptians and other peoples abound in the Old Testament and the cut head of Holofernes is made to look like a funny flower in Judith's "sweet" hands.

> To the south of the city of Los Angeles, in the second decade of our century, a group of members of the Theosophical Society created a tiny city-model where there were no shortage of small industries, gymnastic recreation centres, prayer rooms, auditarium, and where youth groups had been formed militarily organized.

> We have had more late news of the mass persecution of the Nazis against the Jews and of the latter's occasional revenge over the former.

> With the failure of authoritarian political regimes in the Second World War, the mental position is accentuated, and the technical progress is in the middle of the world in the underworld of misery, and the other half in despair for not realizing more goals than those of comfort already achieved or seen to achieve, without being able to assimilate to it. Materialism reigns everywhere; but, beyond the shell, it is an indolent, pessimistic, anarchic and ponderative materialism of the excesses of freedom that becomes liberating.

> \- *Bastion: The option. Jorge Ángel Livraga*

> As the bus runs, modern, with air conditioning and microphone at my disposal, looking at these landscapes, I remember a few words from the misunderstood Benito Mussolini, when he said that the peasants were older and would last longer than the pyramids...

> Not forgetting the past, but without reviving it with anachronistic positions. Vedanta, masonry, Nazism, Franco, etc., have already broken their spears against atheist materialism. Let's use our new spears. The Acropolis. This is the opportunity that the Destiny gives us... Let us not chain his ascending impulse of life.
