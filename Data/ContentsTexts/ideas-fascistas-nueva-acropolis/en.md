# Fascist ideas of New Acropolis

Here we present some quotations taken from the Bastions, Commands and Battlements. Let us remember that these texts are not the only ones in which Livraga set out his ideas. Moreover, in these texts he tried to «veil» his ideology so as not to frighten the members.

> There are not few who begin to criticize the entire work of New Acropolis and its mid-level leadership, or leave our Movement to surrender enraptured to the pseudo-orientalist currents so in vogue, of tambourines sounding on the corners and of languid incenses lit by adolescents with dirty bodies and confused souls, who cover their abandonments with the name of some fashionable Guru. And yet some fall directly into the claws of atheist communism.

> In the Decrees of the RIMM of Buenos Aires, in 1975, the Acropolitan Salute was made official, recommending that the raised arm form a 45-degree angle with the body's upper vertical. This had already been done since the Movement's foundation and its origin was attributed to historical motivations linked to the Roman Empire. The word «AVE» («Sacred», in Latin) that accompanies the physical salute emphasized the latter.

> Let us greet with optimism these new Currents of Thought and Action, as they are darts that are being driven into the flanks of dialectical materialism and of mass liberalism, the two great «Dragons» of our twentieth century against which every Acropolitan must raise the banner of their Ideal.

> Racism is much more dangerous and multifaceted than it seems; it is not exclusive to Nazi Germany with its concentration camps, but extends to the «Israeli Commands» that still devote themselves to hunting down the elderly who belonged to the National Socialist Party.
>
> It is obvious that a collective inferiority complex is often the engine of exclusivisms. The best-known example is that of the ancient Israelites, who, feeling uprooted amid the great centers of invention of the powerful civilizations that contained them, elaborate the dangerous doctrine of being the «chosen of God» and attack every form of faith other than their own, moving from aggressors to victims in an entire historical process of mutual persecutions. Insults and offenses to the Egyptians and other peoples abound in the Old Testament and the severed head of Holofernes is made to appear as a graceful flower in Judith's «sweet» hands.

> To the south of the city of Los Angeles, in the second decade of our century, a group of members of the Theosophical Society created a tiny model city where there was no shortage of small industries, gymnastic recreation centers, prayer rooms, an auditorium, and where youth groups had been organized militarily.

> Later we have had news of the mass persecutions by the Nazis against the Jews and of the latter's occasional revenge against the former.

> With the failure of authoritarian political regimes in the Second World War, the mental stance is accentuated, and technical progress plunges half the globe into the underworld of misery, and the other half into despair for being unable to conceive goals beyond the comforts already achieved or seen others achieve, without being able to grasp them. Materialism reigns everywhere; but, beyond the shell, it is an indolent, pessimistic, anarchic and contemplative materialism regarding the excesses of freedom that turns into licentiousness.

> As the modern bus runs, with air conditioning and a microphone at my disposal, contemplating these landscapes, some words of the misunderstood Benito Mussolini come to mind, when he said that peasants were older and would endure longer than the pyramids…

> Not forgetting the past, but without reviving it with anachronistic postures. Vedanta, masonry, Nazism, Francoism, etc. have already broken their spears against atheistic materialism. Let us use our new spears. The Acropolitan women. This is the opportunity that Destiny holds out for us... Let us not chain its ascending impulse of life.
