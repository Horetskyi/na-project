# Apocalyptic ideas

> Leaving aside the apocalyptic myths referred to the year 2,000 - chronology that only affects Christians, a minority group in the world - the fact is that, in the middle of the first century of the Aquarium Age, the prospects are darkened. The astrological positions and the appearance of unusual solar spots are a source of serious disarrangement in humanity, especially at the psychic level. On the frost waters of Aquarius, a fierce storm is stalled, where many economic, political and religious elements and factors have so far been relatively solid.

> A little talk of madness harasses humanity and we must be prepared to face the greatest disorders.
> 
> On an individual level, also the ethers that cover and protect our lower bodies will be subjected to hard tests, so I recommend that you channel absolutely anti-drug opinion currents and, among Acropolitans, a decrease in tobacco and alcohol consumption and an increase in hygiene in all respects.
> 
> The ceremonies must be maintained, but alternated or associated with works and efforts that "harden" us and make us resistant to adversity and attacks.
> 
> The economic part and all possible elements of survival must also be strengthened: we are approaching a barbaric time in which the weak are going to disappear from the theatre of history. We must be strong and educate our people in strength and purity, for the younger people will need these sources of power so that this new attempt to establish a module of the sixth subrace of the fifth race will not fail without at least leaving deep traces that future travelers can follow.
> 
> You see that, in both aspects, we must renew our Intussivity and Internal Power to overcome the very likely difficulties, which you overcome as the mythological dragon, will allow us access to an Age of Greater Light.
> 
> We have no time to consider the small problems of personality by making us complicit in it. We have to talk clear and strong. I have to be or not be.
