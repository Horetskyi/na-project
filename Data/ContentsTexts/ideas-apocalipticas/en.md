# Apocalyptic ideas

> Leaving aside the apocalyptic myths referring to the year 2,000 – chronology that only affects Christians, a minority group in the World – the truth is that, in the middle of the first century of the Age of Aquarius, the prospects darken. Astrological positions and the appearance of unusual sunspots bode serious disarray in Humanity, especially at the psychic level. Over the icy waters of Aquarius a fierce storm looms in which many economic, political and religious elements and factors hitherto considered relatively solid will be shipwrecked.
> 
> A breath of madness assails Humanity and we must be prepared to face the greatest disorders.
> 
> At the individual level, the ethers that cover and protect our lower bodies will also be subjected to severe tests, so I recommend that you channel currents of opinion that are absolutely opposed to drugs and, among the Acropolitans, a decrease in the consumption of tobacco and alcohol and an increase in hygiene in every respect.
> 
> The ceremonies must be maintained, but alternated or associated with works and efforts that «harden» us and make us resistant to adversity and attacks.
> 
> The economic aspect and all possible elements of survival must also be reinforced: we are approaching a barbaric era in which the weak will disappear from the theatre of History. We must be strong and educate our people in strength and purity, for the younger ones will need these sources of power so that this new attempt to establish a module of the sixth subrace of the fifth race does not fail without first leaving, at least, deep traces that future travelers can follow.
> 
> You see that, in both aspects, we must renew our Enthusiasm and Inner Power to overcome the very likely difficulties, which, once overcome like the mythological dragon, will allow us access to an Age of Greater Light.
> 
> We have no time to consider the small problems of personality by making ourselves complicit in it. We must speak clearly and loudly. TO BE OR NOT TO BE.
