# New Acropolis and the Sixth Subraza

> Within the Acropolis Cosmovue, there is a Philosophical Political Ideology. Its rudiments are integrated into the 1st and 2nd levels of our curriculum. The development of them will enable the New Man to be forged, the bearer of the Star of the 6th Subraza.

> We find ourselves, then, in a completely corrupt world, whose dying pieces fight with each other. I want all Acropolitans of the world to be aware that we bring the Message of the Sixth Subrace that precedes the Sixth Race, the Message of the New Man.

> He is a fundamentally Esoterical and Magical Man. Everything "Hidden" interests him... while watching in his almond. For an Inner Voice tells him that he is threatened as a little child and that the other men are, in some way, his enemies... His "Enemy Brothers" as in the old Myths of Osiris and Seth or Abel and Cain.

> Many shipwrecks cling to the ever-ready scales of our inunending ship and we are more and more. The storm can't be with us. We carry in our bowels the germs of a new world; of that sixth subtract that we must lead to a safe place, beyond the whirlwind and darkness. It is the fifth subrace that perishes in the cold beginnings of this Aquarium Age, but it cannot prevent the advent of the New Man.
> 
> (...) Our Faith is a Light that does not extinguish the damp winds. That light is on our bow where we have an emblem of a Golden Eagle. The Golden Eagle of the sixth subrace. The one that according to the prophecy of the Emperor Juliano would return to Earth with a magic sign between the legs.

> \- *Bastion No. 77: Baking in the storm. July 1977. Jorge Ángel Livraga*

> The economic part and all possible elements of survival must also be strengthened: we are approaching a barbaric time in which the weak are going to disappear from the theatre of history. We must be strong and educate our people in strength and purity, for the younger people will need these sources of power so that this new attempt to establish a module of the sixth subrace of the fifth race will not fail without at least leaving deep traces that future travelers can follow.
> 
> The ceremonies must be maintained, but alternated or associated with works and efforts that "harden" us and make us resistant to adversity and attacks.
> 
> \- *Command No 52: Attention to changes and events. Jorge Ángel Livraga*
