# Reopening of the "Mysteries"

> New Acropolis is, in the external plan, a cultural and humanist organization, and its heart is a philosophical conception in the classical way. But this heart has its own Hidden Heart, which are the Mysteries. Philosophy, as a means, could not lack the Theosophical Objective, principle and purpose of all things. Thus, New Acropolis, in the background, is a School of Mysteries or Theosophical School, giving these two words its original and authentic significance.

> The Mystical Root of the VF is the one that determines its purposes which, in reality, could be summarized in a single Purpose. As explained above, the Root of the VF resides in the Small Mysteries, in those that refer to the discipleship as a way of updating the Human Reality. The Small Mysteries gradually lead to the Great Mysteries, to the culmination of the discipleship in all their Grades, until they reach the Initiations that understand the Universal and Divine Reality.

> The VF is open to all, and all who enter them have the right to know the E.D. with their potential for opening to the Small Mysteries.
