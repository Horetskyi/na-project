# Is it New Antisemite Acropolis?

Since it is common to define New Acropolis as a neo-Nazi association, it is immediately assumed that they must also be anti-Semitic. If we go to objective events, New Acropolis founded the first subsidiary in Israel in 1986, which is still in force today. Delia Steinberg, who was Máximo command after the death of Livraga, was of Jewish family, and in the subjects of theological symbolism, Jewish mysticism - Kabbalah- is considered within the curriculum.

However, Livraga considered Hitler to be a political avatara, and therefore, these facts seem to be contradictory. For this reason, many former members who give their testimony, often say "New Acropolis is neo-Nazi, but not anti-Semitic." In addition to considering Hitler as an "avatara," Livraga also had other ideas about the links between Theosophy and Thule Society (this is what Livraga says in Command 23). These are some of the esoteric ideas or invented by Livraga that support Hitler's predilection without being anti-Semitic.

Even so, the following are quotes from Jorge Livraga about his opinions about the Jews, so that the position of NA and its founder is somewhat clearer.

> I have asked myself many times: How has a people like the Jew, with poor ideological baggage and in constant struggle with everyone, been able to survive whole for 4,000 years? Once he was in the Hilton of Tel Aviv, a fanatic was hitting the doors of those who had the TV running on Saturday; I was filled with indignation. But the philosophical habit of thinking helped me to understand the bottom of that seemingly wild way of cutting individual freedom. He who did it (and who received insults from all the disturbed) really believed that he was doing a sacred duty. Although he was probably not aware of it, he was preserving the Union of his people and reclaiming what, feeling exTERNAL to him, could come to destroy him.

> There I found out where the secret of the force of that ethnic group was inaccessible and closed to the reasonable, in which even today, a Jew has to marry a Jew and vice versa. And where, in the diamond market, which is almost entirely in Jewish hands, transactions are closed for hundreds of thousands of dollars with a simple handshake... the papers and documents come later. Things are done in the family.
> 
> Our strength is also to constitute a great family, in which each Acropolitan must see another Acropolitan as a brother, the Probationists as his little children and the M.M. as a father who, in the Spiritual Key, begot them all, directly or indirectly.

> We must clean up and update ourselves in this regard, and even if we cannot call ourselves "Brothers" because the term is malograted by the orientalist sects, keep the fraternal Spirit. We must help each other in every way, without fanaticism, of course. We are philosophers and we do not put on barriers of race or sex, but that should not lead us to an exaggerated taste for more or less "infallible" "formulas." I repeat: "Give it to me." Say it to your wife and women who are in trouble, which is the most important thing that a person can be in this mental mood.

> A week ago I visited a German city, Cologne, which was incinerated by the bombs, reducing its population, of more than a million inhabitants, to the 40,000 family beings found among its ruins the triumphant "allied" armies. Many of these victims, women, the elderly and children, had not participated in a National-Socialist Concentration. And not many kilometers away, the "Extermination Fields" of Jews were raised - perhaps not as many as the "official" history says, but not less than a million - who, in a good number, did not know what Communism was, and still, were against it. What caused such a monstrous mistake? Fanaticism and physical racism. And if such monstrosities were caused by forms of racism and physical fanaticism... what could not the spiritual fanaticism lead us to?

> We are not Marxists, nor Nazis, nor Christians, nor Jews. We're Acropolis. This does not prevent each Acropolitan, personally, from having its sympathies and antipathies, but it must be taken care of by expressing them so that their personal and ephemeral tastes are not confused with the Acropolitan Doctrinary Attitude.
