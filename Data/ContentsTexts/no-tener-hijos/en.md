# No children

> Thus, he who does not have the means to survive alone, does not charge with companies that do not help him economically; and if he has a monthly income that hardly reaches two, do not put children into the world.
> 
> And not to be fooled that children cost only when they are children, because when they are teenagers and when they are young they cost more, in money and in worries... and when they are adults, they make their lives on their own and only expect to inherit.
> 
> It is not forced that the children of acropolitans are born philosophers... that may look like it while they are children and has not "lowered" their particular ego and their particular karma. A couple of excellent acropolitans can be born children who then engage in drugs, violence, hunting fortunes with their sexes, or... fighting the acropolitans.
> 
> In such a way, the Hachado must not sacrifice his life to engender possible enemies. Rather, be inclined to educate the many young people who need it, because it must be kept in possession of sufficient economic capacity to provide and set an example to others.

> With regard to children, I think it is criminal to put more Souls in the flesh, when by overpopulation, children are born "bounced," almost without devachanic time... More than begetting we must educate, which is what is needed now... But stumbling on the flesh, uncertainties of the Soul, and even economic excuses make some Hachados, knowing, act like they don't know. Fortunately, they are very few, but I cannot give discernment to the one who has no experience. You must understand that many things are not fixed with Decrees and that creating the Sixth Substrate Core is a hard thing, and for some, unsurpassed. I know that Master Morya has said that "There are no impossible but impossible..." but in his sentence the acceptance that there are impossible is contained.

> The population of the world is so large and its projections of greater growth, precisely in the areas less fit for survival; and knowing that the number of Souls (which is fixed from the fourth Souls of the fourth Race) is dangerously approaching the number of bodies, human beings are running out of the necessary "Devachan" and their lives are, in billions of cases, horrific karmic precipitation for stupidity.
> 
> This is not the historic moment to give birth to children, but to educate as many children as possible and to protect children without resources, not only physical, but spiritual.
