# Not having children

> Thus, whoever lacks the means to survive on their own should not burden themselves with dependents who do not help economically; and if they have a monthly income that barely suffices for two, they should not bring children into the world.
>
> And do not fool yourselves into thinking children are costly only while they are children, because when they become teenagers and then young adults, they cost even more, in money and in worries... And when they are adults, they live their own lives and only expect an inheritance.
>
> It is not inevitable that the children of acropolitans will be born philosophers... it may seem so while they are children and their particular ego and karma have not yet “descended.” Two excellent acropolitans may have children who later turn to drugs, violence, fortune-hunting through sex, or even... fighting against acropolitans.

> Therefore, the Hachado should not sacrifice his life to engender possible enemies. Rather, he should devote himself to educating the many young people who need it, since he must retain enough economic capacity to contribute and set an example for others.

> Regarding children, I think it is criminal to place more Souls in flesh when, due to overpopulation, children are born “rebounded,” with almost no devachanic time... Rather than begetting, we should educate, which is what is needed now... But stumblings of the flesh, uncertainties of the Soul, and even economic excuses make some Hachados, though they know better, act as if they did not know. Fortunately, they are very few, but I cannot give discernment to one who does not have it, nor experience to one who lacks it. You must understand that many things cannot be fixed by Decrees, and that creating the Core of the Sixth Subrace is a hard task and, for some, insurmountable. I know Master Morya said, “There are no impossibilities, only the incapable”... but his phrase itself acknowledges that the incapable exist.

> Given how large the world population is and the terrifying projections of further growth, precisely in the areas least suited for survival; and knowing that the number of Souls (which has been fixed since the fourth Subrace of the fourth Race) is dangerously approaching the number of bodies, human beings are being left without the necessary “Devachan,” and their lives are, in billions of cases, dreadful karmic precipitations caused by stupidity.
>
> This is not the historical moment to beget children, but to educate as many as possible and to protect children deprived of resources, not only physical but also spiritual.
