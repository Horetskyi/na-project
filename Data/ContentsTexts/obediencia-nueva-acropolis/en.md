# Obedience

> Without obedience of nothing serves freedom, for the wisest of freedoms is to choose our form of obedience to the Universal Law, represented by our Instructor or Master, to insert us into the Harmony that generates the Just, the Good and the Beautiful.
> 
> \- *Bastion No. 140-3: Freedom and Obedience. Jorge Ángel Livraga*

> We point out that the issues dealt with, or better, to be dealt with, should not become mere theoretical speculations, but should be translated into facts guided by a dynamic of initiative born of the will and obedience to the oath that you have pronounced in accepting your Axis.
> 
> This is how much I can tell you in this first delivery.
> 
> In the name of God, our Lord. AVE!

> \- *Command No 0: Introduction. Jorge Ángel Livraga*

> Yes, Command and Power come from "up" and not from the acceptance of subordinates. A National Command is authorized by the Maximum Command and from Him comes Power, and from his Soul Wisdom.
> 
> Forgetting this is very dangerous; indeed, the most dangerous thing that can happen to an MN. If you give in to the thrust of your subordinates to the detriment of your orders and your own Discipular Destination, you break the Pyramidal- Living relationship with the Fuentes.
> 
> Let's make one thing very clear: the one who wanted to command should be in advance, the one who wanted to teach should be in order, and the one who wanted to be sure should be... there's no other way.
> 
> \- *Command no. 24: relation of the disciple - master, subordinated - command. Jorge Ángel Livraga*

> I want to be your Master and, in the organizational way, a Philosophical Dictator... Why do you push me into tyrannical methods that are against the nature of our Ideal?
> 
> \- *Command No. 53: On the implementation of the Decrees. Jorge Ángel Livraga*

> We do not obey any person or anything, we obey the Laws of the Universe. (...) The Master is, in this case, the reminder of the Law, but in a simpler way, of the laws that are within our reach of disciplic.
> 
> \- *Command number 310: The keys to the action. Jorge Ángel Livraga*

> In truth, if the one who knows what to do commands, and those who do not know, obey, we all win quickly and effectively. (...)
> 
> No system of character control, rhetoric, dialectics, deepening the psychology of the masses and analysis of motivations will have positive results on the student as long as we have not put him in a position to see, to listen, to feel. (...) The Enemy is the Personality of the student.
> 
> Thus, the Enemy is made of inert rock, of florid and thorny bushes, and of caves and fissures from where beasts and insects arise here and there. All this mass will violently oppose the release of his prisoner and instinctively see in the Leader and Professor Acropolitan an enemy who wants to steal his prey.
> 
> You should never dialogue with the burlesque genius; you must open the way no matter how, but using intelligent means to prevent a clumsy enthusiasm from destroying both the prison and the Prisoner.
> 
> \- *Leadership Manual (1976). Jorge Ángel Livraga*
