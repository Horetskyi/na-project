# «Survival Module» in the Age of Aquarius

> Thus, New Acropolis must be a "Module" or "Vehicle" of Survival of all Values. A sort of Ark that floats upon the waters and carries the germs of the Old Age to the New Age; from the old and glorious Man to the new and victorious Man. It is also like a bridge; it must be firmly built so that it can withstand the strain between the two banks and through which the Humans who recognize themselves as such can pass, always remembering the existence of God and the very existence of their Immortal Soul, beyond the countless reincarnations.
> 
> There will be cataclysms and wars and guerrillas that will diminish the population, as well as pestilences and plagues, such as the rat plague already appearing in New York. It will be Nature's way of halting demographic growth that threatens to leave the Souls — their number being fixed — without Heaven or Devachán between incarnation and incarnation, with the problems caused by the lack of Celestial Life and by the failure to forget the animal hardships and joys of material life.
> 
> In the face of such a panorama, NEW ACROPOLIS has the responsibility to keep alive the Dreams, the Traditions, the "Initiatory" Elements, which will serve the Lords who will be Kings if one knows how to build them a Throne.
> 
> For all this we speak of the OINA as a "Survival Module", comparing it to those vessels that traverse the cold, dark space, carrying within a skillful and resolute crew, which does not mind dying so that the Project may be realized.

> Many shipwrecked cling to the ever-ready ladders of our unsinkable ship and we are increasingly numerous. The storm cannot defeat us. We carry in our entrails the germs of a new world; of that sixth subrace that we must lead to a safe place, beyond the whirlwind and darkness. It is the fifth subrace that perishes in the icy beginnings of this Age of Aquarius, but it cannot prevent the advent of the New Man.
