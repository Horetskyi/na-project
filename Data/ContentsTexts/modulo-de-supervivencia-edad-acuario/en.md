# "Survival Module" in the Aquarium Age

> So, New Acropolis must be a "Module" or "Vehicle" of Survival of all Values. A kind of Ark that floats over the waters and brings the germs of the Old Age to the New Age; from the old and glorious man to the new and victorious man. It is also as a bridge; it must be firmly built, so that the tension between the two banks and through which the Humans can pass, which as such are recognized, always recalling the existence of God and the very existence of his immortal Soul, beyond the countless reincarnations.
> 
> There will be cataclysms and wars and guerrillas that will weaken the population, as well as the eyelashes and pests, such as the one of rats already found in New York. It will be the system of Nature to stop the demographic growth that threatens to leave the Souls - being their number fixed - without Heaven or Devachan between incarnation and incarnation, with the problems of the lack of Celestial Life and of forgetting the hardships and godly animals of material life.
> 
> Against this background, NEW ACROPOLIS has a responsibility to keep alive the Dreams, Traditions, "Initiatory" Elements, which serve the Lords who will be Kings if they are able to build a Throne.
> 
> For all this we speak of the OINA as a "Survival Module," comparing it to those ships that surf the cold and dark space, carrying within a skilful and determined crew, who does not mind dying for the sake of the Project being realized.

> Many shipwrecks cling to the ever-ready scales of our inunending ship and we are more and more. The storm can't be with us. We carry in our bowels the germs of a new world; of that sixth subtract that we must lead to a safe place, beyond the whirlwind and darkness. It is the fifth subrace that perishes in the cold beginnings of this Aquarium Age, but it cannot prevent the advent of the New Man.
