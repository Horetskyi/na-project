The memory text is remembered. It's been many years but **Daniella Squadoni** He closes his eyes and says, "In the presence of my immortal soul and my fellow men in the search for wisdom, I commit myself to **serve with loyalty** and effectiveness and, if not, that fate, the gods and my national command reproach me. "

That's what he said in his **commitment to loyalty**when it was admitted as part of the **New Acropolis Living Forces**, an organization that is presented as cultural and philosophical, but that is pointed out by specialists and former members as a sect. Not only here: it was founded in 1957 by **Argentina Jorge Ángel Livraga** and his wife **Ada Albrecht** and, spread around the world, is present in 54 countries. In Uruguay it has two headquarters, one in Pocytes, one in Cologne.

Daniella entered at age 14 after a **conference on alchemy** But only when he was 18, he became a member of the Viva Forces. That day he was wearing a blue uniform and a striking bracelet, just like all the people around her. He was on his knees in front of a banner with an eagle and his right hand raised.

It was acropolitan, as they call the members of that organization, for 11 years. He left in 2014 but it took him a good time to process everything that had happened to him. Today, at the age of 33, remember:

\- I never planned on leaving. It was better to die than **leave New Acropolis**I was told it would change the world. It wasn't Daniella, I was acropolitan.

The Encyclopedic Dictionary of the Sects, written by the late Spanish priest Manuel Guerra and perhaps the most complete work that exists on the subject in Spanish, defines New Acropolis as a "esoteric, neo-pagan and paramilitary sect, of theosophical imprint."

The facade, they explain there, is the realization of courses of various themes, such as philosophy, martial arts and volunteering. They're "hooks," when you say war. But over time some are encouraged to integrate into a hidden structure of an organization that seeks to create a "new and better world," with its Living Forces (which include male or working brigades, female brigades, as well as the security corps). There is also a select group of leaders called hashados, who have a greater commitment.

In order to enter, you have to pay a tithe, which varies between 1,200 and 1,700 pesos per month depending on the place of the person, in addition to specific donations and the obligation to work at least three or four hours a day. Most do it from the tardecite, after leaving their work or studies. There are 112 members today.

## This is how members of the brigades dress.

In the internal activities the members of the male or working brigades - who are in charge of repairing things, among other tasks - wear shirt and light brown tie, shoes and black pants. They do parades and exercises of mental control and personal defense. They're wearing an orange bracelet. The members of the female brigades, blue and white blouse. The bracelet is dark blue. They deal above all with the social and maintain the "beauty" of the places.

The distinctive "hashados," which have a higher level, is an axe. They wear pants, shirt and black tie. They use an axe-shaped pin, to which they are entangled with gold chains as they rise.

The members of the security corps, meanwhile, can carry weapons, according to the Encyclopedic Dictionary of the Sects. In Uruguay in some very specific case they do, as El País knew. The uniform of the members of the security corps, says that book written by the Spanish priest Manuel Guerra, coincides with that of the Nazi SS. They wear a red bracelet with an S and an arrow. The position of Chief of Intelligence may be known, but his activities must be secret, as well as his contacts.

Luis Santamaría, a Spanish expert in sects, responds to El País from the city of Zamora and reports that Nueva Acropolis has "an external appearance of cultural association" and "an internal reality of an initial group of hidden doctrines."

\- Why is it a cult?

\- It is a group that has a double reality - says this researcher of the Ibero-American Network of Study of the Sects. The intern is an esoteric school to go teaching the adept successive mysteries. This is a characteristic of the sects: the procedures of recruitment with that deception and the techniques of persuasion. The same is true of the progressive break-up with previous social relations, something that should not happen in a cultural organization. And then the person sees it hard to get out or he doesn't even think about the way out because the outside world is bad.

\- What are the leaders looking for?

\- They're the chosen ones. They are convinced of that very elitist truth for very few people. They want to reach an acropolitan social and political system all over the world, with resonances of Greece and the Rome of classical Antiquity.

As there are no, except for specific cases, reports of sexual abuse or money problems, it is difficult to find a specific crime, Santamaría explains, and says that psychological manipulation or coercive persuasion "is difficult to demonstrate" and "embarrassing for those who went through the experience."

## The secrets.

"I call on the Immortal Gods to give you all the Light and the indispensable working capacity to travel the steep path that leads from Earth to Heaven," says the Leader's Manual, written by Jorge Ángel Livraga in 1976. It also mentions that there are three fundamental symbols: the eagle, fire and axe. But those symbols don't see them who go to the philosophy talks.

In the Encyclopedic Dictionary of the Sects, War states that when the acropolitans deny something of their internal structure that is imputed to them, they do not lie, because "they are limited to defending one of their foundations, to keeping the secret to avoid sharing it with those unprepared for it or with those who can stain it." The inner, the esoteric, is reserved for "the wisdom of the elect."

What can be communicated to all, "the exoteric," is "like the mask with which to come before the uninitiated." To reveal an acropolitan secret is "classified as a betrayal."

It's not a religion, but it looks like it. One of the secrets is that acropolitans believe that life is marked by "elementals of nature." What are they? The elementals of the fire are the salamanders; those of the air, the sylphs and the elves; of the water, the nymphs; of the earth, the gnomes. They also believe in the emergence of a new race, which they call the "sixth subrace," endowed with the "sense of clairvoyance or perception of the invisible and unattainable to the senses." And they say that in a moment the planet will begin a "long process of disintegration."

War speaks of a "paramilitary sect with a neo-fascist sign." In fact, a 1985 European Parliament report on fascism and Nazism mentions New Acropolis. There are some elements that explain this definition. The official acropolitan greeting, "in private, never in public," is the arm in high with the palm of the hand extended down, fingers together and at an angle of 45 degrees over the body. The eagle of wings deployed in ascending position is similar to the Nazi eagle, says War. And the training, we'll see, is very hard.

Among the obligations of the acropolitans is "to be always available for the task that is entrusted to them," to be moderated in alcohol ("have the elegance of not falling into the beiss, which stupidates the people"), in smoking and in sexuality (chastity is a desirable ideal and in a text of the founder is advised "not to surrender to the unbridled"). It is recommended that vegetarianism be removed from politics ("the current political positions are empty of spiritual content"), that "be removed from drugs, homosexuals and thieves," have little relationship with people outside, engage in the recruitment of sympathizers, give lectures and organize seminars on different topics, from archaeology and esoterism, to India, Plato and the mysteries of Tibet. It is mandatory to do a course of prayer and to paste posters of dissemination throughout the city.

And what do they say from New Acropolis? The website states that the principles are those of brotherhood, knowledge and development of the human being. Its director is Gabriella Feola, a 66-year-old chemist who held positions in the Montevideo Intrend (IMM) in the last decade, was director of Resilience Unit and the Quality Assessment and Environmental Control Service. He met New Acropolis in 1994 by a co-worker at the IMM, who invited her to participate. And he denies any accusation of a sect. "We have nothing to hide," he says and laughs when he answers by phone to El País.

The New Acropolis version will be counted at the end of this article. Before that, in order to better understand the allegations, it is essential to know the testimonies of those who were inside and left.

THE STRUCTURE

## The commander and the guardian of the stamps

The acropolitan scale has various steps. Above all is the world's supreme commander (who is today the Spanish Carlos Advanced), then the continental and national. It has a solid gold axe with "a multifaceted emerald embedded on one side of the axe's head." Then comes the guardian of the stamps or deputy director general, who carries an axe with iron head, which contains "two golden hands keeping a flame."

At the other end, the first step is "probationism," where the person is on the test and receives lessons in philosophy, socio-political, the reincarnation of souls, Buddhism, Plotino, the New Medioevo "that will end democracy" and Western well-being, and other issues.

## The stories.

Martin came in as a teenager and met a nice world, with happy faces, where they paid attention to everything he said, although at first he was surprised that in the course of philosophy there was talk of esoteric issues without giving room for debate.

\- Years later I would find out that they even have an integration secretariat that is dedicated to analyzing people and seeing what activities they can propose based on personality, to hook them up - this execropolitan says, in interview with El País in a bar of the Center of Montevideo, and asks not to be identified with their real name: he is afraid of reprisals. You're very unprotected from that structure, there's a strong handling mechanism.

He learned that it was more important to go to New Acropolis than to spend time with his friends and family and educated him that the right thing is that "an evolved being" does things he does not want to do "in pursuit of the common good." Although at that time he felt well and supported, in a very subtle transition he began to inculcate ideas such as that the doubt was negative, typical of "kama- manas," the selfish mind. He also learned "the ideology of obedience."

\- The one who knows, knows, and I don't question it.

A few years later, he was told that Jorge Ángel Livraga is a "half-life being, one of those characters who, through their spiritual development, captured eternal truths." And those who follow him are also special beings. That the world is "in brutal corruption" and that it would have to be "like in there," like in New Acropolis.

\- They believe that we are in the Middle Ages, that civilization will collapse and that it will only survive New Acropolis.

It wasn't one day for the other but there came a time when it only related to people of the organization, radicalized and looked "twisted" to those outside:

\- The problem is, the darker things are introduced to you four years later, when you broke ties with everyone and your life is in there.

\- What's the darkest thing?

\- You entered into philosophy and mental openness and in the end they tell you about obedience. And I have to accept it. Because the cost of leaving is too big. And it is gradual the process by which rationality is being curtailed and where you are made clear that to question something is to be in lack. And then you read the texts of the founder, who had admiration for Hitler, Franco and Mussolini, how can it be that so many years later I find out what he thinks of life?

![Una sala de la sede de Nueva Acrópolis. Foto: Juan Manuel Ramos.](5.jpeg)

The invitation to belong to the internal circle, the Living Forces, was a long process that ended in the so-called "field tests," which in some cases (not all) can be traumatizing. In Uruguay they are held in the "Roman villa," a country house in Pirarajá, Lavalleja.

The journey is in strict silence without knowing where they go, when they get there are read writings of the founder and then they sell their eyes. Among other tests where the aspirants are naked, they take a rope that means "the way of the teachers, that is, New Acropolis" and throw them to one side and to the other; they bury them a while in a well with an inch of earth above their head until a horn sounds; they take them to a lake and put their heads in the water; they make them go up to a place and jump into the void without knowing where it ends, until they fall into the water. And everything like that.

"The most humiliating thing is that I accepted it," he says, resigned.

In the end, when he was already a member of the Viva Forces, he sat two hours looking at the bracelet and entered a room where all are formed and the famous engagement must be made. Then they asked him not to betray "the ideal and the teachers" and gave him a symbolic cache.

\- They educate you in that terror. They play with the candy and the stick, but there's less and less candy and more stick. And in a moment it's all stick: every time you do something that doesn't fit the sect, you're a selfish who doesn't think of others - says Martin. I remember the perfect moment when for the first time I thought about leaving and I was terrified of my own thought.

And when he finally left, he started a personal "martyrdom" in order to move on, crying every night and had to be advised by a psychologist.

The story of Ana, 35 years old and whose name was also changed to preserve her identity, is quite similar, but it happened in Spain. He came in for a psychiatrist's conference and he was 10 years old. He left six ago. Tell your story to El País while traveling on the subway:

\- I was very fanatized. He went every day, Monday to Sunday. I'd left friends, family and study. I was just thinking about the cult. All my time out of work, I was doing that.

He made everything from cleaning up the headquarters, "taking" the website and doing public relations. Then he taught and there he had the first problems with his teachers for clashes.

\- Because at first you're in a dream and you think you're the one to save the world, he explains. You end up believing that the leader Jorge Angel Livraga is an envoy of spiritual beings, who is called the white hierarchy. But you went in there to something else and you end up like this, so it's a 100% sect. There's a lot of psychological coercion.

His experience in field testing was equal to or more complicated than Martin's. He says that they hit him and made him slap a partner ("and if you went loose, you were shouted to be strong"), but he could not express pain. The worst, he says, was when in winter they took her to the mountain, covered her eyes, stripped her and put her in a river with frozen water.

\- For what purpose?

\- They didn't tell us. You just had to obey. Then I found out it was to control the emotions.

When he left, they told him that his soul was "off," that his soul was "dark." She had to redo her life: she was alone and was 29. "It's hard, because you come out thinking the world is bad," he says, "it's hard to trust again."

We're going back to Montevideo. At her old town house, accompanied by her boyfriend and three cats, Daniella remembers she tried to catch all her friends.

\- Luckily I didn't make it. I invited them to conferences and recitals. They were going to bounce me but they didn't stay because they were not interested - I would laugh. But in New Acropolis they started to talk to me about them, they told me they were all weird, I was going out... They consider me almost as a traitor for having friends outside.

He said that they also got into the aesthetic and asked him not to dress in a frenzy way, to be more feminine and elegant, without "overshowing, without being sexy."

And he sums up:

\- All the time they pressed for everything, for how you dressed, for what you did, what you were talking about.

But she took "pressure" as evidence. Years after his departure from New Acropolis - which accelerated after someone uploaded photos of her on Facebook drinking alcohol in a camp and disguised as vampires with her friends, and where he also had a strong depression he suffered - he made public his bad experience through different videos on social networks. So much that he became a reference to the subject and in the last year he was written to dozens of people from all over the world. His departure, he says, was "a crunch of freedom." He lives today as a personal coach.

## Love bombing.

Thursday, after 8: 00. At the reception of the headquarters there are people who come in and out, some who come to courses, others who are members of the Living Forces and devote much of their life to the organization. In the turn is Angkor, a playful laborer dog that the acropolitans rescued from the street, they say.

They smile nice, sweetened. In the house of Franzini and Scoseria everything is ordered and pulchre.

On a wall the huge Plotino library (by the neoplatonic philosopher) is raised, classified according to different categories, such as sacred texts, Chinese philosophy and esoterism. An acropolitan arranges flowers and then appears - also smiling, of course - Feola, the director, accompanied by Mauricio Puente, who is director of the center of Pocytes.

He saw a black shirt with the New Acropolis logo. She is a colorful blouse and wears a pendant with a small axe. Also an ankh or key of life and a beetle, two Egyptian symbols. His smile transmits peace although his face will change during the talk. But not at first: whenever there is a new visitor, it corresponds to what they call "love bombing."

![Gabriella Feola y Mauricio Puente de Nueva Acrópolis. Foto: Juan Manuel Ramos.](7.jpeg)

"I will put it to record," says Feola and put his cell phone on the table.

\- There are allegations that New Acropolis is a sect.

"Let us know," replied Puente, "there is a blog where five people with names and names speak that.

"There are always people who disagree," adds Feola. Sometimes they don't understand us, or they didn't find what they were looking for and they were frustrated.

\- But there are things that are repeated in the testimonies: that there is a facade of courses and that then you try to capture to integrate them into the Living Forces.

"First, we don't get anyone," says the director. And we have nothing to do with sects: the one who wants to leave, goes. And the one who comes back, comes back.

\- It's clear he's free but they say there's a time when the decision to leave causes terror.

\- Oh, that's an extremely subjective vision. I know where it comes from. "It is not so," says Feola. People are committed to coming. We do not avasalate or try to separate them from their relatives.

\- But in a text by Livraga it is asked: "It begins to break useless chains with friends and friends who do not participate in your ideal despite knowing it, and with everyone, whoever it is, to oppose your present spiritual vision, for maintaining these old relationships will hurt you and those people, who have not yet awakened as philosophers; who would be ashamed of you or mocked by what you have of the most sacred: your acropolitan ideal."

"That is not current," she replied. The institution is adapted to the times.

\- But the founder wrote it.

\- Well, the founder at a historic moment. There are totally obsolete things.

\- It's like I got an article from the '70s from El País.

\- They're different things. The Encyclopedic Dictionary of Sectas, by Manuel Guerra, defines New Acropolis as a "esoteric, neo-pagan and paramilitary sect."

They laugh.

"Neopagana, paramilitary, Nazi," said Puente. Since you're a research journalist: the one who wrote that is a priest, he has his bias. They also consider masonry as a sect.

On the hard entrance tests, they both take away transcendence and say that they are "symbols and ceremonies," similar to the baptism of the Catholic Church.

"He does not undress the person or put it in a well," says Puente.

"We don't even get hurt," adds Feola.

\- He seems pretty crazy.

\- Out of context, you don't understand.

\- Sabri - they talk to a girl at the reception - was it traumatic for you to test land, water, air and fire?

\- No, not at all. I remember her with love. We're all big, says she.

The talk ends and both offer a visit to the two-storey house. On the top floor there are three classrooms and on a wall a picture of the founder, Jorge Ángel Livraga. Below, a cafe, a room with four people in charge of the networks and another space that functions as a conference room and place for martial arts.

The tour is over, but something's missing.

\- Can I see the temple?

\- No, that's reserved. There are our symbols.

No more nice smiles.

JORGE LIVRAGA

## The Founder's texts

Jorge Ángel Livraga, founder of New Acropolis, says in the Leader's Manual, to which El País agreed: "It is necessary to ensure that ties with dissidents are not maintained for sentimental reasons, because if, being inside, they have failed their obligations, it is easy to infer that they do not understand or love New Acropolis. Saving them with positive and friendly images is an invitation for others to follow their tracks." It is a clear message of cutting ties, but from New Acropolis the authorities deny that this text exists. In one of its bastions (texts), Livraga says: "The pyramidal system is not an option. The judgment of authority cannot be discussed." About having children: "A couple of excellent acropolitans can be born children who then engage in drugs, violence, hunting fortunes with their sexes, or... fighting the acropolitans. In such a way, the Hachado must not sacrifice his life to engender possible enemies."
