# The "External Facade" of Normality

> Isn't it possible that, by carrying out many outward-facing activities that can provide a relative prestige, or rather a "mask of prestige", we are losing the opportunity to give our Members the necessary attention and control?
> 
> It is my view that the National Commands should commit to a selection process that is highly truthful and free from personal preferences regarding external activities which, while on the one hand give us that "mask" of eclectic activity, on the other deprive us of identity with our own Principles and Ideals.
> 
> I believe that if we continue to devote so much to the "facade" of our Institution while neglecting the people who already make it up, the annual loss of Members will continue.
