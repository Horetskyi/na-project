# The "External Fachada" of normal

> Is it not possible that, by doing many activities facing the outside that can give a relative prestige, or rather a "prestige mask," we are losing the opportunity to give our Members the necessary attention and control?
> 
> It is my view that we would have the National Mands, which are to focus on a very truthful and absent selection of personal preferences regarding external activities that if on the one hand they give us that "mask" of eclectic activity, on the other they take away identity from us with our own Principles and Ideals.
> 
> I believe that if we continue to devote ourselves so much to the "facade" of our Institution by neglecting the people who already form it, the annual loss of Members will continue.
