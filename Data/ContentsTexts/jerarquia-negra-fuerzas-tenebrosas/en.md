# The "Black Hierarchy" and the Dark Forces

> And believe me of one thing: those who reach the summit of the Black Hierarchy receive a personal and individual training and submit to the same sacrifices, the same labors and the same trials as those in the White Hierarchy. That explains their capacity to dominate and why they can fight as fiercely as they do. But as long as we are in manifestation, it was logical that an effort as extraordinary and as wonderful as the White Hierarchy would give rise to its counterpart, because every body casts a shadow on the ground, and the White Hierarchy had to cast a shadow because it manifested — and its shadow is the Black Hierarchy.

> The so-called "Yogis of the White Mountains": they are the very essence of Inner Activity and with their superhuman minds they propel Humanity toward every form of progress, fighting in ultra-psychological states of consciousness against the nefarious mental forms that resentful peoples collectively engender and that are cultivated by the Dark Lords or the Black Hierarchy.

> The Work of Restoration of Ancient Knowledge to which New Acropolis is committed — and in which thousands of young people are bled — truly does not care about it at heart, although it may appear otherwise. Of a sensitive spirit, the illness of its Astral Body makes it mawkish, and in the midst of the fierce battle we wage against the Dark Forces, it is porcelain already cracked inside and out, which hinders the feet of those who work and forces them to move with the greatest care so as not to touch the fragile psychological structure of the affected.

> The acropolitan must know how to silence his Kama-manas and cleanse himself of those feminoid elements (in the worst sense of the word) that hurl him into the arms of subconscious animality; of the spirit of flight, of turning his back on life and of allowing himself to be seized by the Dark Forces. He must avoid that kind of psychic violation so that elemental larvae do not later arise within his astral and mental body and desiccate his Soul.
