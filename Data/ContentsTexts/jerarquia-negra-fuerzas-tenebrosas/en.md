# The "Black Hierarchy" and the Dark Forces

> And believe me, those who come to the top of the Black Hierarchy have a personal and individual formation and who submit to the same sacrifices, to the same works and to the same tests as those in the White Hierarchy. Hence their ability to control and hence they can fight as hard as they do. But as long as we are in the manifestation, it was logical that an effort as extraordinary and as wonderful as the White Hierarchy would give rise to its counterpart because any body shone on the ground, and the White Hierarchy had to shone because it manifested and its shadow is the Black Hierarchy.

> The so-called "Yogis of the White Mountains": They are the very essence of Inner Activity and with their superhuman minds they drive Humanity towards all form of progress, fighting in ultra-psychological states of consciousness against the nefarious mental forms that collectively engender the grudges and are cultivated by the Dark Lords or Black Hierarchy.

> The Old Knowledge Restoration Work in which NEW ACROPOLIS is committed and in which thousands of young people are bled, has it, in the background, without care, although apparently the opposite. In a sensitive spirit, the disease of his Astral Body makes him sensitive, and in the midst of the fierce battle we fought against the Dark Forces, it is porcelain already slashed inside and outside, which hampers the feet of those who work and makes them move with great care so as not to pluck the fragile psychological structure of the affected.

> The Acropolitan must know how to silence his Kama- manas and clean himself from those feminoid elements (in the worst sense of the word) that precipitate him into the arms of subconscious animality; of the spirit of escape, of turning his back on life and of being kidnapped by the Dark Forces. You must avoid that kind of psychic rape so that they are not born, then, within your astral and mental body, the elemental larvae that will resound the Soul.
