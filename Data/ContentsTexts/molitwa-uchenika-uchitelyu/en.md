Teacher! Give me the ideal to fight for. An ideal for which I could not only die, but live. Teacher! Give me a new name, and I will carry it through life. Teacher! Give me a little of your knowledge to scatter it, Like seeds of goodness, in the open hearts of men.

Master, give a drop of your understanding as if by sea. I will sail and reach the shores of the Dream. Give me the spark of your faith, I will carry it around the world in my hands, igniting everything. That I would meet on the way before the darkness became light.

Teacher! Teach me that this world is straw, wood and perishable. Not only will I know, but I will know when the fire is over. Give me your understanding, but not the solution to my problems. Teach me how to beat them.

Show me your strength so that the one who sleeps in me may awaken. And that you may become a reliable companion on the path of eternal ascent. And if one day I find myself weak and reach out to You, Don't reject it, take it, squeeze it so hard that I feel pain. With my soul... I will continue the path and I will not be alone.

Teacher! Give me a piece of your love. She's going to be yeasty. The bread of kindness that grows in my heart. All this is so necessary for me! And now, in our world, where there are no enlightened masters, Teacher, don't tell me too much.

I did not choose you, but you chose me, so become my master. I do not see this humiliation for myself, but sincerely need it. And let me stand with you shoulder to shoulder in battle.

And if you stumble along the way, lean on me, So that thou shalt not touch the earth, in my dreams thou art And we are unshakable, and your gaze is upon the stars and the sun.

When death comes to me, give me confidence. That life will not end there and will continue. And if you leave first and do not consider me worthy As a sacrifice to be on the chosen Path, let me follow You.

Have me, Master, in whatever you think worthy. I will not. I'm not afraid of danger. I will always hear your voice. I will not speak your teachings, I will obey your heart. And I will continue the work, Master, for You through this life. And then into eternity...

I don't want Heaven. Don't promise me that. The only thing I want is To create a new, better world, not for myself, but for my brothers. Who do not know their causes, and why they shall be born into the light, And die why... Let them one day find what is in you. How I found it...
