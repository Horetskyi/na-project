The Chambers have adopted and We ratify the following:

### CHAPTER I. — Preliminary provisions

Article 1. This law governs a matter as referred to in Article 78 of the Constitution.

Art. 2. For the purposes of this law, a harmful sectarian organisation shall mean any grouping with a philosophical or religious purpose, or which presents itself as such, and which, in its organisation or practices, engages in harmful unlawful activities, harms the individual or society or undermines human dignity.

The harmful character of a sectarian organisation shall be assessed on the basis of the principles laid down in the Constitution, the laws, the decrees, the ordinances and in the international treaties on the protection of human rights ratified by Belgium.

### CHAPTER II. — Information and Advice Centre on harmful sectarian organisations

Art. 3. An independent centre is established at the Ministry of Justice under the name "Information and Advice Centre on harmful sectarian organisations", hereinafter referred to as the Centre.
The seat of the Centre is situated in the administrative arrondissement "Brussels-Capital".

Art. 4. § 1. The Centre shall consist of twelve full members and twelve alternate members who shall be appointed by a two-thirds majority by the Chamber of Representatives. Six full members and six alternate members shall be appointed on the nomination of the Council of Ministers and for each vacancy to be filled two candidates shall be proposed.
Language parity between the Dutch-speaking and the French-speaking members shall be ensured for both the members appointed directly by the Chamber and those appointed on the nomination of the Council of Ministers.
At least one full member and one alternate member shall be proficient in German.

The Chamber of Representatives shall elect from among the full members the chair and the vice‑chair.

§ 2. The members shall be appointed for a term of four years, renewable once, from among eminent personalities known for their knowledge, experience and interest in the issues related to harmful sectarian groupings. They must provide all guarantees enabling them to perform their mandate in complete independence and in a spirit of objectivity and impartiality.
The full and the alternate members may be relieved of their mandate by the Chamber of Representatives if they fail in their duties or bring the dignity of their office into disrepute.

§ 3. To be appointed as a full or acting member and to retain that capacity, candidates must meet the following conditions:

1° to enjoy civil and political rights;

2° not to be a member of the European Parliament or of the Legislative Chambers, nor of a Community or Regional Council, nor of the Federal Government or of a Community or Regional Government.

§ 4. Members of the Centre are prohibited from being present at deliberations on matters in which they have a personal or direct interest or in which their blood relatives or relatives by marriage up to the fourth degree have a personal or direct interest.

§ 5. When a full member is prevented or absent, he shall be replaced by his alternate.
A full or alternate member whose mandate ends before the expiration of the four-year term shall be replaced in accordance with the procedure referred to in the first paragraph by a full or an alternate member appointed for the remainder of the term.
The King shall determine the modalities concerning the remuneration of the members of the Centre.

Art. 5. The Centre shall draw up its rules of procedure within two months of its installation. They shall be submitted for approval to the Chamber of Representatives.

4° provide support and guidance to institutions, organisations and providers of legal assistance;

5° consult or invite to its meetings qualified associations and persons which it deems useful to hear.

The King shall determine, by a decision deliberated in the Council of Ministers, the guarantees concerning the confidentiality and security of personal data, the status and duties of an officer for data protection within the Centre and the manner in which the Centre must report to the Commission for the Protection of Privacy on the processing of personal data.

§ 4. The information that the Centre provides at the request of the public shall be based on the information available to the Centre and shall not be presented in the form of lists or systematic overviews of harmful sectarian organisations.

The adopted opinions shall reflect the various positions set out.

§ 2. The Centre may have access to the full stenographic report of the public hearings of the parliamentary inquiry committee of the Chamber of Representatives with a view to policy-making to combat the unlawful practices of sects and their dangers for society and for the individual, in particular for minors.
