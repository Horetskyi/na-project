## Absolute dedication to the Ideal and breaking ties with the outside

Every day that passes, every hour that passes, every minute that passes you must dedicate it entirely to Acropolis. Every day we must work for Acropolis, and try to recruit a member, paste posters, carry out all the necessary tasks of translations and exchanges that will allow us to have more and more brothers, more joined hands, more raised arms pointing to the horizon.

In our Movement we do not ask you to be an anchorite, but begin to break useless chains with friends who do not participate in your Ideal despite knowing it, and with anyone, whoever they may be, who opposes your current Spiritual Vision, for maintaining those old relationships will harm you and those people, who have not yet awakened as philosophers; who would be ashamed of you or would mock what you hold most sacred: Your Acropolitan Ideal.

We must avoid the psychological trap laid by "Kama-manas" of feeling the time devoted to New Acropolis as something "torn away" from our lives. The truth is precisely the opposite; the only useful hours of our present incarnation are those dedicated to the Ideal. Everything else is dust that the wind of life is charged with scattering.

The idea that one must be "prepared" to form disciples should not be limited to an intellectual, nor even a cultural, preparation. A determined and awakened will that allows A REAL CONTACT WITH NATURE AND WITH THE GODS is worth more… The era of "encyclopedism" has passed!

And if there are "old disciples" who do not understand this, they should be transferred to Headquarters and given scholastic tasks, leaving the front-line work of recruitment and defense of the Ideal to others younger at heart, more "aggressive" and vigorous. We need, on the "cutting edges" of the Empire, people totally devoted to the Ideal, with simple and clear ideas, of natural ascending strength, who do not make major problems about anything.
