## Absolute delivery to the ideal and breaking links to the outside

Every day that passes, every hour that passes, every minute that passes you must dedicate it completely to Acropolis. Every day we must work for Acropolis, and try to make a member, paste posters, perform all the necessary work of translations, of exchanges, that allow us to have more and more brothers, more hands united, more arms high that point out the horizon.

In our Movement we do not ask you to be an anacoreta, but it begins to break useless chains with friends and friends who do not participate in your Ideal even though they know it, and with everyone, whoever it is, to oppose your current Spiritual Vision, for maintaining these old relationships will hurt You and those people, who have not yet awakened as philosophers; who would be ashamed of You or mocked by what you have of the most sacred: Your Acropolis Ideal.

We must avoid the psychological trap of "Kama- manas" to feel the time dedicated to New Acropolis as something "torn away" in our lives. The truth is just the opposite; the only useful hours of our present incarnation are those dedicated to the Ideal. Everything else is dust that the wind of life is in charge of spreading.

The thought that you have to be "prepared" to form disciples should not be limited to an intellectual, even cultural preparation. It is more worth a determined and wakes-up will that allows a real deal with NATURALEZA and the gods... The time of "encyclopedism" is over!

And if there are "old disciples" who do not understand this, we have to move them to the Central and give them scholastic work, leaving the first-line, the collection and defense of the Ideal to others younger in heart, more "aggressive" and powerful. We need in the "cutting edges" of the Empire people fully given to the Ideal, of simple and clear ideas, of natural ascending force, that do not make any greater problems at all.
