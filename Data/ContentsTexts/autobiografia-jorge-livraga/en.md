# Autobiography by Jorge Ángel Livraga

*Published in the 1-18 Almenas of New Acropolis. Internal document.*

## Introduction

As announced in No. 1 of "ALMENA," I intend to develop the theme of our relationship with Hierarchy and how we came to the world 24 years ago. Being the Founder, these simple pages will acquire historical document value when time passes. In the face of this evidence I am compelled to write something that my Personality strongly rejects, but which is necessary for the understanding of events and for there to be no important deformations of the knowledge of my own Life in the future, which could have an impact on a deformation of the whole Work. I mean to write a kind of biography, a brief account of my existence, from my earliest childhood to the steps of what would eventually become the New Acropolis International Organization.

Saving the abysmal differences between H.P.B. and I, I intend to avoid from now on that some future R. Guenon and his followers invent a tortuous and false beginning of the origins of our Movement. Thus, by saving the repugnance that my Personality feels in the subject, I am forced to write about myself. I am used to sacrificing the pleasurable for the sake of what is necessary. I do it again. I keep orders like any of you.

By the beginning of Etica I will stick to my own life and relate to what may be of interest to the better understanding of the process. I will limit myself to those things that may be important and known.

## Part One: My childhood (1)

I was born on September 3, 1,930 in the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina, within a family of Italian migrants. My parents, Don Angel and Doña Victoria, were born in Argentina, but my grandparents were born in Italy, in the vicinity of Milan by father and in the vicinity of Genoa by mother.

I saw the light shortly before noon at my paternal grandfather's house, on the street of Ciudad de La Paz to 800 of the residential district of Belgrano. A few days later, a bloody revolution broke out, defeating the paternalistic regime of the center-left of Hirigoyen. The first doctors who attended me were brought to the house through the barricades; the city was overflown by combat aircraft. I was born normally and did not know premature diseases.

Within a few months I was transferred to the house of Amenabar 863, which my father had designed, who was a civil engineer.

Argentina knew at that time a time of wealth and my first childhood passed into a high middle-class family, with the typical characteristics of the "new rich." He set up a toy room for me and I was sleeping in some kind of a truck in my parents' room. I have a very vague and timely memory of it. I remember our car, a sand convertible with the black rangers. Also a villa on an island of El Tigre, located in the delta of the Rio de la Plata at about 30 or 40 Kmts of Buenos Aires. I was told that when baby, I had clung to a cloth bear and that I started talking very soon, although I was late to walk alone. I don't remember that. The first thing that comes to my memory in this life is to sit in the car with your legs hanging without touching the pedals and trying to maneuver the steering wheel. I also remember the boat that took me from time to time to delta island; that experience I loved.

I grew up with a very reserved character and spent hours alone, watching and dreaming in front of the huge roof maceteros of my house that was 20 meters long. From what I've been told and I remember, I don't think I was "playing" exactly like an ordinary child. I was displeased with the other children and I always preferred to be close to the older ones, for example, my father's big table of plans, scribbling with his compasses and tyrants; with his German "Faber" pencils with which I was very soon engaged in drawing, usually ships and human figures in combat. I don't remember drawing animals at that time. Although I liked them, and thanks to my father's friends in the Buenos Aires Zoo Garden, I had access to play with tigers, lions and bears. I never feared the animals. A friend of mine at the Zoo was a great monkey "Chakma," a type of chimpanzee of huge fangs and good size. I fed him in the hand when my elders didn't see me. The first time I was surprised to do so, they were horrified, until they realized that the monazo did no harm to me and, on the contrary, showed their fierce teeth to those who wanted to get away from it. I loved the animals so much in my first childhood, I got to have many, even a penguin in my parents' bathtub, which was quickly forbidden. It had very populated freckles and a large cage where parrots were flying and parrots were walking. I don't remember worrying about their food; but I did spend hours looking at them and I began to dream of far-off lands.

My father wasn't religious and my mother was just in form. Semanally we went the same way as the church of which I was most affected by the images and the high ceilings. They tell me that I was baptized in the Catholic religion, in the New Pompey Neogotic Church and that I cried a lot when I was wet with the holy water. They got over the problem giving me to play the key to my maternal uncle's car, Angel Rizzi.

I don't remember any religious impression or experience in my early childhood. I've seen and touched family dead since very early. I wasn't most impressed. These experiences were forced by my father, very "machista," who wanted me not to be afraid of anything. I really didn't. I remember seeing the dead with curiosity, as if it were the clothes that had been taken out of the deceased, from which I thought they should remain alive somewhere else. But he took it with great nature. What really impressed me was the weeping of the deudos. They were bothering me and trying to run away from them.

I always loved silence and, somehow, loneliness. I was very curious about my surroundings, but I saw it unpersonalised, as an immense display of those museums that I had already started to love since I was very small. His quiet and silent objects always attracted me.

I have the feeling, as I strive to remember my first years, of a great psychological distance from my surrounding world. I don't remember loving anything or anyone much and, contrary to what happens to the children, I didn't feel any need for affection. And if affective life had, it was always turned to a greater degree towards animals and objects, feeling an indifferent rejection by humans. Somehow I didn't feel like a human being, nor did I think I had a similarity to them, beyond the form, that I didn't care about.

## Part One: My childhood (2)

Near the age of 4, I lived frequently with my father grandmother. She had a large house in the Palermo district, with an uncovered background, where lemoneros were raised, legumes were planted and there were hens. In truth, it was a rustic estate and there my sexy grandmother lived as in the far-off countryside of the Pó, of which I was so much told.

As soon as it was morning, she was going to mass and back, she woke up the whole little family. He stood almost all day, working, and lay well weary among his paintings of saints and dead to whom he lit a lamp of oil for each one. She was rich enough to carry another kind of existence, but she knew only that one, and was serene and naturally happy with her.

In a little house of the funds, there lived a guy-my grandfather, his nephew, about 10 years younger than her, who had been anarchist, of those practical-romantic of the late 19th century. They both had a few discussions about the validity of religion, until my grandmother applauded him by reminding him that he was his aunt, and he, who always treated him respectfully of "You," was immediately silent and returned to his work on earth. He mocked her beliefs, but respected her and wanted to the extreme that when she, many years later, died, he followed her to the grave, never replaced by her aunt's loss. Anarchist strangers then!

I played making great holes on the earth, filling them with water and making my little boats bake in them, some built by myself with wood that I found there. For me, that house and its rustic background was a place of wonders. I spent hours looking at insects and plants. I started drawing birds on large sheets of pencil drawing paper. Then I would color them imitating what I saw.

I was drawn to the hens and their strange property of laying eggs. I never understood how or why they did it, but I didn't ask about it because I had become used to the riddles and in a way I did not want to hear the untold answers of the elders. One morning I found out that putting a finger on their beak and wanting them to sleep, they fell immediately, with their legs up. Then I'd blow them and they'd wake up. I was hypnotizing them, but it seemed to me the most normal thing in the world, until one day my grandmother surprised me and put "the cry in the sky," for apparently an indirect ascendant of mine, whom they called in Italy "El Maguito," had earned his life by levitating from roof to roof of his little town, healing animals and people. The challenge of a priest - against what was thought to be diabolical powers - cost him his life by wanting to fly from the bell tower of the Duomo in Milan. My grandmother reminded him of what she had been told as a child, and had inherited her "miraculous medal," where she was represented "San Gnop." I don't know who this mysterious saint was who they also called "Lord of the worms." Today I believe that the medal in question could well be a simple Paleocrist currency.

The thing is, he called my father on the phone, the one who, when he heard the story, laughed and thought that the grandmother was choking. I was recriminated to be deceived by my games, taking advantage of her being a simple peasant (my father was very proud of her quality as a university and a lover of mathematics, of her scientific culture). Then I was invited to go to the hens and repeat the experiment before them. My grandmother with the rosary in her hands, and my father enjoying in advance the failure of my game to a qualified observer. I slept all the chickens. I remember confusely that they were shaken unbelievers of what they saw. I was a little angry at the publicity made on the matter and I refused to wake them up, until I received an urgent order from my father to do so. Then, almost in flyers, he took me to the car waiting for him at the door, while my grandmother was retreating to pray to her dark room, before her beloved saints and dead. There was no more talk of the matter, but within a few days they took me to my doctor, Dr. Rioja, to check me out. Now I realize that he would have been told the adventure and the optional old man, trained in the pragmatic schools of the early century, must not have believed them, certifying only that my health was good. But it wasn't that much: I often had a cold and a grind and they gave me high fevers. They say he was delusional. As I was an only child, the house convulsed every time it happened, and the suffering and prestigious Dr. Rioja ran to meds me. He and my father got along very well, as they both had a highly scientific and positivist mentality.

I'd be 5 years old when I suddenly got sick of the flu, one winter, and the fever got me to 40 or more degrees. I was at the house of Amenabar and the girls in service, my mother and father were on the tiptoe, while they were renewing my cold water cloths on my forehead. They also wrapped me in big wet bowels. They started giving me several painful injections a day. Today I assume he would have an amago of pneumonia. In an evening the fever went up even more, I almost lost my vision and it was hard to breathe, hurting my back. It caused the general alarm. I remember my mother's running and screaming, "Call Dr. Rioja!"

I was just in the room. Suddenly, to the right of the great bed in which they had placed me, a figure was standing, bathed in golden light, with arms crossed on the chest (years later I knew it was an Egyptian figure). He stretched out an arm and touched my forehead. I didn't get scared and I told the people who came into my room when I called them to tell them what I saw. The doctor came and attributed it to the fever. I saw the concern in everyone. The next morning I had no more fever and there were no traces of my illness. I got up and went to play in the yard. The phenomenon was attributed to the reaction to some medicine.

## Part One: My childhood (3)

I myself soon forgot what had happened to me and took it almost naturally, although I couldn't explain it then. I didn't care to explain it either, and that feature of not worrying about the apparently "supernatural" was with me all my life.

Since I was 4 years old I knew how to count and the memory abecedary. He could read, though with the problem of knowing the Italian language more, in the form of the Milan dialect, than the Spanish language. At best, I would mix them both as I heard my elders speak when, at the table, I had long opportunities to listen to them.

After five years of age, my personal tastes were strongly emphasized in me. Make maneuvers and change the wheels of my father's car, draw, now in color, observe nature avidly, especially animals and plants, and a growing hobby for travel. The latter made me start to build a great mature, made of drawer wood and sticks, in the courtyard of my house (without calculating that it was so big that I could not get it out of him). With this raft, which consumed many of my daily hours and thousands of reused nails, which I straightened myself, I thought I would go to places... "very far away..." like "India and Montevideo..."

My father, who was obviously not born for child pedagogy, had, however, an infinite delicacy to show me the impossibility of my project and together we were disarming it, replacing it with a very small, with a candle, which we would throw into the Rio de la Plata to be lost on the horizon. This is how we work. I think that a week and I don't remember crying, although I did want to do so for for the first time in this incarnation the obvious failure of a dream had struck me. Months later the raft was working away from the coast and they began to make me many gifts of models of all kinds, responding surely to that hobby that I had shown and that, in some way, never left me. When I first saw the sea, I would be about 6 years old; I remember crying without knowing why. It was in the spa of Mar del Plata. I spent the hours looking at the horizon, beyond the waves and sand, so tempting for the games of children my age. I recognize that I must have tested my parents' patience and ability to understand, for while I was always a very obedient and circumspect child, I was also rare and atypical to the end.

It was decided, with great joy of mine, that I would not go to primary school at the age of 6, as usual, but at the age of 7. From something I never understood, I felt a great rejection for going to a school and being with other children and I felt that with that step my way of life, my childhood, would sink. I had a real horror of becoming an "older person." To get me into an environment I was presenting was going to be aggressive. The fact that I was growing up, which was celebrated by my family, made me terribly sad. I had in my house Amenabar a piece full of toys; there were hundreds of them, and I was trying to play alone with my ships and cars, with my little planes, with eating thirst. I was aware that then my life would change and I could no longer do it the same way.

I went back to my grandmother's house, and there was the last strange phenomenon of my childhood. It was a simple thing, but it determined that my stay in that house, with the large fifth of vegetables and fruit trees, would be reduced to sporadic visits.

There was a lemonero loaded with mature lemons and my grandmother gave me a basket and pointed a long stick at me to try to harvest all possible. They left me alone and I was raised with the problem of how to do it exactly, because the fruits were numerous and were, for me, at high altitude. I put myself under the tree and I strongly wanted the lemons to fall to the ground; I raised my arms to collect them, and a large number of fruits fell at my feet. I didn't give it any importance, thinking that those who were left on the tree would then come down with my compressed air rifle... but I didn't realize that my grandmother was looking at me... and again the theme of "The Maguin" came out and what had happened to me was reproduced by unconsciously hypnotizing the hens.

I think that's where my childhood ended. Then I had to go to school, doing the first year in one of the nuns, from the Av. I remember confusely having suffered a lot, even an accident by falling on a stone bench where I lost some of my teeth and got hurt a lot. I became silent. He rejected and was rejected by the other children. The "duties" I had to do at home, with my mother's half-time help, were a real martyrdom, except when I had to make drawings. My notebooks are still preserved and are very polished and beautiful... but they don't reflect that almost horrific inner feeling I felt in making them. A change, a year later, to a State School, did not improve the thing. There I learned the first bad words and the first filth of life; I saw the weak steal and beat. A strange, powerful and atavic force began to manifest itself more clearly within Me. I isolated myself from the environment and it was just a "robot" kind of going to school. The occasional little friends ended up showing me up as objects.

## Part One: My childhood (4)

I remember the destabilization of my life as it grew. And my clashes with my surroundings.

The State Primary College, which when I write still exists on Avenida Federico Lacroze and Cabildo, in Buenos Aires, seemed to me to be a real prison. For the sake of evils, my father, with his liberal ideas, had not wanted to continue to send me to pay and religious school. At that time, in Argentina, the State Schools were attended by children drawn from the middle class down and from their customs to their clothes had nothing to do with mine. It still seems to me to hear the booby-hairs and whistles of my little companions when my impeccable robe (there it is called "guarapolvo") white, starched, and my blue-faced tie with white, silk polish, went up to my family's big black car, which I was waiting for.

I never felt identified with them. To be totally frank, as I have proposed when I began writing this microbiography, with very few exceptions I felt genuine disgust for that vociferant, degrained and violent child mass. When, in passing through the "Ritz" confectionery, they would buy me a package of candy to share with them, I would... But in my way: I threw them away (they were of the most expensive, wrapped in colored papers with the representation of the fruit that gave them taste) and it was a fun for me to see them hasty, pushing and beating themselves moved by the gula. The one left for me used to give it to my dog, a great German shepherd. My parents knew a lot later that I didn't eat candy. They also knew much later that I was not a child... "normal."

The psychology of most parents is curious; they always expect their children to be something "out of order" and when one is born to them, they are hampered in "normalizing it." My grandmother told me something I don't know yet if it's true. He said that when a wolf intersects with a dog and is born to a puppy - wolves and puppies - dogs, he waits to see how they drink the water and that by the way they do, they know whether wolves or dogs are born to him, killing the latter, for his instinct tells him that, when they grow up, they will be the enemies of the wolves... Nature is ruthless, but wise.

So I grew up among dumb wolves that let me grow. To Me, that so many Articles would write against the dogmatic Church... taught me to write in Spanish a nun. To Me, who fought all my life for Materialist Liberalism and despised Democracy, they worked to teach and form teachers of these tendencies, starting with my own father.

I was a mediocre student, very bad for mathematics, but very good in history and literature. However, my culture astonished my elders, for in a self-taught way, I read several hours a day what I wanted, especially astronomy, paleontology, zoology, botany, physics, history, archaeology, verses and prose. He also made outstanding scientific drawings representing cells, mushroom classifications, bird varieties from distant countries. But it was "For Me" drawings... that I don't remember my school teachers coming to see. I would not be 10 years old when I collaborated at the professional level on a series of technical drawings that my father presented as projects of new highways, roads, with their schematic cuts, description of drains, contrapisos, etc. My father was increasingly my partner despite the abyss that opened up his violent character and my incipient altaneria, contempt for vulgar outbursts, and family discussions.

In truth, my father lived for Me, for his economic position allowed him and his greatest Love was his son. I was his pride and his realization in life... but he might have liked a non-enigmatic child. And let him settle for less. When I made a comet and we went to the field to get it back, I ended up asking for an aeromodelo.

My father tried to teach me sports, especially violent, like boxing, but although he did not avoid them, he did them mechanically and there was such coldness and contempt in my eyes that the gear and sacks of sand soon disappeared. I did like to row, sail in general and had many models of ships and submarines.

The outbreak of World War II coincided with my birthday. We were buying toys at the center of Buenos Aires, when we heard the siren of the newspaper La Prensa announcing that Britain and France had declared war on Germany for its invasion of Poland. I was 9.

Argentina continued to live its pace. It was a distant war and it was completely undramatized. My family was Italian but I lived clinging to the past. We sang next to the piano "Giovinezza" but Mussolini seemed to them an operetta character; some because they were monarchical to the old way and others because they were, like my own father, democratic liberals. For Me, unconscious of human pain, it was an interesting episode that I read on the pages of the "London News," with his impressive photos. An avalanche of war toys sharpened my piece. The phenomenon of war completely dehumanized, like that of simple fighting machines, came to me to be very interested and having bought hundreds of small armed cars, cannons and other miniatures on scale, organized and resolved intricate battles. He helped me with small rockets, which he buried in the land of the pots like mines. At first I was in favour of the "Allies" because they were losing.

## Part Two: My Teenage

I have taken the term "adolescence" by pure means of communication with you, for, strictly speaking, I do not remember these very well-known changes in my life today. Only a kind of anguish to realize that I was no longer a child, but not for not knowing exactly what I was expecting, but rather for knowing with certainty everything I lost. The world of adults had never liked me and I was forced to enter it gradually. A time-bilogic process, with forces higher than mine, pushed me... but I was still the same inside... there in my interior...

My taste for reading had led me to read from a meticulous article on the tablets on Easter Island, in whose photographs I worked several weeks in various attempts to identify the graphics, to a book about "how to throw the cards" that is, to know the future through the cards of a deck. I didn't believe much in those things, but alone, I made the cards run on the big dining table in my house and I got frankly happy once I thought I read that I would die at the age of 15. I was so disgust at the lives of adults.

Later I knew that my intuition about those letters had not been completely false... Only that it wasn't I who would die physically when I was 15.

From the hated Primary School I went to the aborted National or Secondary School. If in the first I had felt uncomfortable, in the second I had to resort to the limit of my forces to stay "normal." The young teenagers of my time seemed to me as beautiful as those of now, with the difference that then I had to endure their rudenies, their obscene conversations and their stupid tears. The mediocrity, when not the nullity of my teachers bore me and there were very few exceptions.

Of the "subjects" he studied I was interested in history, although he presented it deformed. He found pleasure in Literature and always could spend many hours reading the Spanish Classics and also blending quartillas with verses and essays on politics and descriptive and narrative prose. Of the authors translated into Castellano, the one that influenced me most was Chateaubriand, and to a lesser extent Byron. I was also interested in religion, although in my time as a student, in Peronist Argentina, the absurd division was made between those who studied "Religion" and those who "Moral," the latter being all deceptively qualified as "Jews." That displeased me and seemed absurd, even because I knew that almost none of those I had chosen "Moral" were of Jewish origin, but simple children of non-Catholic parents. But the "matter" was able to awaken in my soul the lightning of curiosity. In truth, I no longer believed in what my Catholic grandmother and my liberal father had taught me. I had to look for some way for myself and this was a lot of passion for me. My position on the religious problem was somewhat sceptical and I tried not to deny or affirm anything to which my reason could not support. He kept, yes, a few intrinsic mystic elements on which I did not dare to question myself, such as the very existence of God and, in some way, the immortality of the Soul and the priority of all good over all evil.

My continuous readings had made me known to some extent the Greek pantheon, the Roman and especially the Egyptian, for which I felt a pararrational inclination. My reflections made me see that it was a kind of Divine Essences that took on the geopolitical and historical and pletoric forms and characteristics of popular or cultural attributes that imposed places and times. This obviously led me to see in Christianity one more form of Faith, as transient as the others.

My family's habits made me take Communion and Confirmation, but I had done it with the same inner absence as I did so many things. My inner world was increasingly disconnected from my environment. No protests, quiet but inexorably.

When the Second World War ended, in the face of the defeat of the Axis, my old sympathies for the Allies had invested in their polarities and von Runstedt's counter-offensive filled me with enthusiasm. The one who so few fought against so many would awaken in Me a hidden fiber and make him resound powerfully. Military issues and the love of weapons became very alive. What he would then call "Instinct of Power" was awakened, and in the face of certain revelations of sex I chose without any struggle for the most absolute chastity, not for moral but for rejection of what he considered to be signs of animality and vulgarity. The concepts of strength and chastity were for Me inseparable. And when they pointed out to me that a Alexander had not been precisely casto, it did not make me a problem, because I thought how far it would have been. But that tense and yet natural evolution was going to suffer a kind of cataclysm. The one who ended my adolescence and what we could call, first youth.

I just turned 15.

## Part Three: My Youth (I)

My 15th Anniversary was one of the saddest in my life or at least so I remember now. A number of factors joined together; one, the main fact that my father, so strong and corpulent, began to be shot down by a disease that doctors already suggested as incurable, a kind of uremia-leukemia. Another, the evidence, for Me, that he had entered the world of adults. The usual jokes and the keys to my house and the car, which have been at my disposal since then, with great palms of my little but fervent family, seemed to me to be an absurd masked. If I didn't plan on changing my way of life or "running away" anywhere... why did I want the keys to the house? As for the car, we had driver and apart, except for the fact that I was not old for the regulatory driver's license, I had never been spared the use of the car.

As I was already "Major" I was fully entrusted with the more or less close probability of my father's death and the typical "machismo" of an Italian family of the years that pushed me to start taking responsibility and preparing to be "the man of the house."

The first thing I did was take out my driver's license by surpassing the test with an ease that in no way honors the one who was driving cars since childhood. Then I dedicated myself with a very cold mind to preparing my own mother and my grandmother and other women in the family to attend my father's long, terribly painful agony, without adding with his cries greater despair to the thing. I do not know, and I did not ask myself, where that serene, externally cold force came from, which gave me an aspect of enormous psychological maturity and even a certain contempt and "cynicism" in the face of the terrible problem we were experiencing. Today I think it was an atypical need to survive in the face of adversity, but I do not remember realizing it at that time, even today I am not quite sure of it. Did I get "Help" from my "Invisible Friends"? It's possible.

As 1946 advanced, my father's state became frankly agonic. He suffered the unspeakable and the few moments when, by virtue of painkillers and remedies, he enjoyed full lucidity, he shared them with me by playing the domino or by explaining to me the very difficult mathematical problems in which he was loosened. The subject of his next death never touched him directly in front of me, but he spoke to me as if we both knew it without any doubt.

For not putting another conflictive element in my house I didn't suspend my studies, but I didn't care about my "Baccalaureate" or my personal future at all.

So much I saw my father suffer and so I could see the moral and physical demolition of all of us around him over the months that I came, not only to accept that he was dying, but to wish him to do so as soon as possible. I had become cold and my eyes were almost always dry even in the many moments when despair surrounded me, between rhymes, rims and the continuous smell of "Hospital" that had taken hold of my house. The wolf dog who had given me as a child, called Rhin- tin- tin and whom I called Rinti began to howl at night, sowing terror. I'm quite frankly saying I made him shut up more than once with a kick. A new force grew at an accelerated pace in Me and a remarkable power to conceal my emotions and crush them within Me.

One night, finally, my father's titanic body, reduced to skin and bones no longer resisted and at dawn he apparently died without realizing it. The family convulsion was tremendous. My eyes were still dry and I fulfilled the greatest desire of my already deceased father: to behave like a "man" in adversity. I was very natural to play that role.

On June 4, 1948, he was in the first carriage, still lying by horses, which accompanied my father's body to the cemetery; to the great vault or "Pantheon" family of green onyx. I attended the "In corporate unburied" Mass with the attitude of watching a play. I still didn't know... But I had become totally atheist.

The interior change that had been caused in Me was terrible and I needed medical assistance for my nerves within a few weeks, because I had lost the will to eat and to sleep.

I turned down and left my studies. I became lonely and tacitturn. Sitting at my father's desk, I was going through my hands with his multicolor planes and his many papers and notebooks full of mathematical formulas for hours, or in front of the wheel of the big black car that was in the garage of my house, an inner voice was repeating to me that the paper or leather had lasted longer than my father. I began to feel disgust and to make quiet fun of family religious beliefs. To Me back then, it all ended with death. He felt no anguish, but a deaf despair accepted as part of the stupid destiny of existence. He was strongly convinced that every religious form was a mere escape from the most important reality. For Me the only one at that time: He who all ends death; that there was no God and that morality was only a form of elegance.

## My youth (II)

Without changing my recent convictions, a very rapid mutation of deep roots began in Me. My father's death had left me as "mutilated" but at the same time I had opened up the doors of freedom.

I took advantage of the summer to go to a far-off curfew of a maternal guy. There I really learned to ride a horse and took a shower in the handling of hunting and defense weapons. I liked loneliness, but it was no longer that contemplative of my peaceful childhood, but the one that sits on the chair of a sturdy chisel when I gallopar without direction for the immense lone pampas. A thousand small adventures were harming my body and soul... although at that time the second term would have been ruled out of my conception.

I sold the big black car and bought a Ford V 6 "coupé-club," with two carburetors I took part in some racing and railles. I loved danger. I remember that one of my workouts was to go through with the car, at high speed, on a rail bridge without rails on the sides, supporting only the wheels on the slippery metal rails. But I had a lot of luck and a lot of expertise because I never had an accident. I also dedicated myself to the sports rowing and occasionally to the sailing. I loved to "lose" alone in the maze of "El Tigre" channels, a place close to Buenos Aires, where the Paraná River flows into the Silver River in a delta complex.

From the National High School that no longer carried out some possible adventure companions, boys of good economic position and as unemployed as I. They gave me a virgin world for Me; that of unpopular music. "Concert in Warsaw." "Tables of an Exhibition," then led me to deep immersions in Beethoven and Wagner. I spent hours listening to the records. I also made brief incursions through the nationalist youth organizations and founded "CADEL," the Argentine Free Students Center, which would then group thousands of people. I discovered myself as a good promoter and organizer, with a great capacity for work and concentration on a point or core of effort. He ate little and slept little. Something was violently fermenting in Me, but I, back then, didn't even suspect what it could be.

Peronism had entered its apogee in Argentina and, while its gross and left forms mixed with an insulting nationalism displeased me deeply, its spirit of challenge to the world attracted me. I never entered any political parties, but I collaborated with the CGT (General Confederation of Labour) at the university level on development plans for the workers. These plans failed, since the workers, not prepared previously, raised the wooden floors of their houses to light the fire of their roasts.

Taken so many experiences in a couple of years, deeply modified, I decided to give the exams pending to enter the University, at the Faculty of Medicine.

With my few colleagues, I also discovered the world of fashion books among young people. I read Kafka and Sartre, Marx and Hitler, Kant and Max Scheller. But, although I was interested in some points, none of these authors fully convinced me because I saw all of them starting from certain "A priori," which seemed too fantastic and unpositive to me, as I returned inexorably after long evocations to the same point of departure from which they were convinced before starting their reasoning. These "Closed Circles" of reasoning and assertions seemed to me vicious and without a verifiable truth. I preferred to go back to my old readings of verses, literature and novels, which at least delights my needs for adventures.

As I had to give my language tests and in English I found great difficulties I decided to take classes from a particular teacher. That was going to take me in the arms of my Destiny... But then I didn't even suspect it.

My English teacher turned out to be a German named Schmidt, already old, low and chubby, with a constant and enigmatic smile, who told me to have lived in Tibet and traveled a lot in his life. That made me attractive from the very first moment, as I fit perfectly with my dreams of making travel through mysterious countries and living dangerous adventures.

One afternoon I entered his home as an academy of languages to formally begin the classes, but in my astonishment he did not resort to the conventional books, but he presented me with some voluminous manuscripts written in Sanskrit and Tibetan. He translated his teachings into English and Spanish, and in a few hours he told me about the origin of Man, reincarnation and other esoteric things. To show me what "Maya" was, he sent me to take a pencil that I saw on his desk, but by posing my hand on him I didn't find it. That wonderful world made me meet my Inner Being and when I left his house it was another. I didn't know either, but the one you now call "JAL" was born.

## My youth (III- XVI)

*The remaining sections of autobiography (Youth III-XVI) continue to relate the esoteric learning of Livraga with Professor Schmidt, his entry into the Theosophical Society, the construction of an Egyptian "Crypta" in the basement of his home, his correspondence with Jinarajadasa and Sri Ram (world presidents of the S.T.), his practices of unfolding and alchemy, the closure of the Esoteric School in 1950, and finally Sri Ram's instruction to create a new movement separate from the S.T.. With this, Livraga sold his car, launched the magazine "Theosophical Studies," and founded New Acropolis at the age of 27, with a first group of 12 people in his house in Amenácar 863, Buenos Aires.*

> My youth was left behind and what you know for "JAL" was born today. Why tell you more? I haven't said everything that happened in those first few years... but what I told you is true, simple and simply true. I leave the gods the responsibility to take pity on my soul if I made mistakes. And if they don't have mercy, I don't care. NEW ACROPOLIS is in progress...; in its XXVI Triunfal Year, its Solar eagles rise on over 80 Sedes in 34 Countries. I have excellent disciples and thousands of young people work for the Ideal and shout my name. Can I order more? I think not; my work is almost finished and what I have left of physical life belongs entirely to the ideal. I'm sorry if I didn't tell you everything... I'm a Son of the Secret and I'm referring to that Secret... to the Great Mystery of why and how We, the Acropolitans, are going to change history to forge a New and Better World.
