Today ' s instructor will also be devoted to the laws we spoke about yesterday, 7 plans, and from the point of view of the coach, how they can be used to return to the general concept of training of trainers, to those moments that need to be taken into account, which is very important not only for high-level trainers, but for teachers at the zero level. This is for those who do not yet organize small groups or major lectures, but work with people in one way or another in the direction, within the zero cycle and the first cycles, to have at least some kind of nucleus to communicate with people, giving them a certain boost that must be kept in mind.

Let's at least try to consider what we have in the law, remind you of plans, start from the top and come down.

With regard to the Atma Plan (Law) is the Unity Act.

The Enlightenment or Sanitation Act (Budge-Husse plan) is as follows.

The Plane of Manas is the Law of Differentiation.

Then there's the organization (Kama Manas, less mental).

The Law of Mentality is the Astral, the Psyche.

Act of activity, labour, fleas, energy

The last thing everyone remembers is the patrol code, the cycle, and the physical plane.

How do you think we can apply them to train trainers on the coach model?

If you recall, the Unification Act is the guiding principle that leads everyone to one world destiny through the path of development, and as they say, if you ask how many, you say, "one," it is said to relate to awareness of communication with small or large organisms and awareness that we are part of something bigger, and it is said to be linked to the awareness of chains, that is, the principle of freedom or the transfer of fire, which has created the entire universe. Thus, to the smallest creature in the universe, the shooter loses nothing, does not change, does not fall, and does not remain the same. Every link in the series is, at the same time, father, son, teacher and student that he gets from someone that he gives to someone and yesterday, when we speak of the general features of the principle of unity, we said that each of us lies in molecules of everyone in the same chain with us.

...

I've heard more than a few things, and they're actually coming to the same thing. First, when we talk about the law of unity, but all the laws, we have to separate the two points from one point.

The second point is actually the famous principle we spoke about when we spoke about the law of unity, which is of great relevance to the coach. So, if we speak of the principle of denials, we can apply it to the horizontal level and to the horizontal level, when it comes to the meeting that I prepare, the topics, and the approach, I must always communicate with someone who always needs to know who I am.

Now, from the point of view of the Penal Code, with regard to this principle on the helicopter, that is, the chain that extends from the top, we said yesterday and several times to teachers that each of us has particles of teacher and lecture reading, a lesson, a conversation, a conversation, a composition plan conversation, each of you must give a piece of yourself, even though it seems to be abstract and theoretical, but if the meeting is usually a problem, then part of yourself will be. So the first thing we know is that we're carrying a piece of Hal I'm not saying mines. Adding his moments that created his own style, and when we read Hal, when we listen to him, an invisible man, a light coach, can immediately absorb the most beautiful system that Hal Sri Ram and other masters teach, because for a gentle person who can see and really hope to be a good trainer sometimes (and if you don't feel that way, I'm a bad coach), you can't always feel that way, sometimes with a company.

First of all, I'd like to say, "I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get through the last few minutes, and then I'm going to have to say, "What's the point?"

Now, if we speak of the Uniform Act in the same lecture, if you don't take the trainer himself, not the condition that he was, in fact, any kind of union that we should hold in the lecture, in the meeting, with whom and between whom and whom we should be united?

You see, some of the things that people do to you, the so-called hidden bonds at the beginning of the lecture, and the thanks you can bring to the end, your mission is that you have to be a very close person, especially if you work with them as a teacher, even though they may not talk to you at all, because you don't get a little lecture. What we must move in this context is to plant seeds in the human spirit, something great means touching someone, and with regard to the Unification Act, the most beautiful transmission occurs when you feel as a group centre as one, as a whole, it is not necessary to touch a specific person and not talk to specific good people who look at you and smile while others sleep.

And then I'll go straight to the physics, and then I'll go back to the psychiatrist to unite, to create in a lecture, in a meeting, a small spirit, a collective form, if you remember, or to awaken the collective spirit, not to speak to people, but only to the collective spirit of the group, the effect of which is that what you say will be relevant to everyone and you will be prepared for the purpose of ed.

The last point is that, for you, I will crush you too, one day you will understand, and from the point of view of unification, we speak of the need to teach people not only to transmit information, but to teach, by making a lecture, to teach people how to think, think and feel.

The next law, the law of desecration, enlightenment, spirituality, etc., we spoke yesterday, there is no spiritual person who has no light, no evil, no ill-informed head. And first of all, to be more instructors, even though you, like me, will always be scared, there will always be a paradox: "List again," you have to want to dream, like to be a coach. I'm sure if I woke you up in the middle of nowhere, I'd say it's not like I'd be able to tell you.

And then, what kind of idea is that, if I remember, when the light begins, it goes off to a whole bunch of colors, which, in the eyes of the teacher, does it really matter? If you talk about the vertical structure of the Bluto State, or about four types of people, or about different worlds, or about four centuries, or if you're gonna find out about it, you're gonna have to come up with some kind of question. In the same system that is already normal for you, when you ask a question, you find the answer, which automatically leads you to a new question. ctor should be, say symbolically, a person who, within the fram Then we have always said that the discovery of the main moments is to go back to the same thing and always find something new in the same thing and this new one, which is on the basis of the old, is to take into account another veil.

We go further to the principle of organization, which is one of the most logical principles -- Kama-Manas -- and as we say last, this is logical, on the one hand, and on the other hand, it works in time and space, and we say ten times that the coach must organize his lecture first.

There's another point. I took a break and told you everything.

In this context, the topic should be organized as follows: this is a moment of experience and Hale is usually also spoken of, in their great understanding that the most important thing is the moment of formation in a lecture, which is true, in a lecture on "Latto", in a lecture on Socrates, in a lecture on history philosophy, in a lecture on artificial mathematics, the same thing is said.

The next law is the Law of Mentality, which, from the view of the instructor, speaks of the process of creating colle ctive astral and mental forms. otor of his awareness and revelation, it is necessary to make certain words, terms, become vocabulary, frequent expressions in ordinary life, the subject of anecd otes, scenes, congratulate, pots. Even for the point that it is necessary to reach the point that sometimes it seems to have already surpassed, that there are concepts that are already used everywhere, chewed everywhere, and that it is better not to speak about them (of course, one must be careful not to be paralyzed) that the concept of dreams, or the city of gold, and all members are already saying, wake them up, from any center of the city, "Dream," is to show of hope, to show, to act, to act," It means that, in the first place, there's an emotional charge, there's no such thing as a babbling, or that's what you say.

Finally, from the point of view of dental law, a lecture, a profession, a theatre, in principle as an ideal model and not ideal, what does it mean? Again, we said that a trainer was an actor, and what he did, whether a meeting, a orientation, a small group or a lecture, had to make people not listen, but participate in what he said. And why would I say to share, and why would I say it's a one-man theatre?

The next principle is the Act of Activity, the procedure, as we have said, this is a popular dynamism. But when it comes to the stage, it's a little more healthy to act, not to anger, but to a rebellion, to the same stalemate that he sees, and it can't be conquered at all, because he paints words like a gum, so he can't help himself.

And then the last two moments of the law of frequency and cycle are very brief, and we also talked about it in the different marathons of teachers that our lecture should be built on sessions.

More importantly, although we've talked about this before, in addition to these disturbing emotional strikes, it is always necessary to give a chance to escape and a lecture without jokes without moments of laugh is not a lecture.
