## Evaluate

After doing this, the Commission has to admit that the sex phenomenon is probably long enough in our societies. It expresses the inevitable disfunction, and sometimes it's a kind of cluster, which leads to the incomprehensible marginalism. The right-to-difference must also be protected. But you can't allow this right-wing to be threatened by some principle, primarily by the weak. That's why fighting the sectarian deviations, the Commission's opinion, remains a requirement that requires more means, new efforts to inform society and awareness at an international level. The Commission is strongly aware that the tradition of contradictions between the freedom of conscience and public order in the matter of sectarian activity is absolutely inconvenient. It's not about counteracting these two principles, but it's also about lighting their complexities. Saving the freedom of conscience cannot be based on ignoring basic individual freedom: freedom of movement, possession of property and use, caring for its own body and health, protection from abuse of power, protection of suspension on their moral and material interests... Working on this freedom on the side of the sectarian population is more closely persecuted and punished, the Commission seeks to guarantee the freedom of conscience and expression that lie in respect of human rights.
