Pawnia and South Korea,

Article 19 of our Constitution will recognize freedom of faith. The state is secular, it allows everyone to express their thoughts freely, except when it's been conducted by crime.

Sex are using these freedom, recognized churches, in order to reinforce and acquire fans in our country.

Sexy can be defined as an agreed union of the minority of volunteers of innovation, which share the same elite faith, obeying charismatic leadership or hierarchical, central and authoritarian administration, whose purpose can be religious, political, economic, or other, but the main statement that has to be pure ideas about the divine that needs to be governed to ensure their salvation.

(\*) The first session is 49th legislative assembly.

A recent journalist investigation reports about the presence of Belgium in about a hundred cult connecting about 50,000 followers. This phenomenon can take more and more spread and is not safe.

Under the cover of the spiritual search, sex is gradually tearing down their followers from any contact with the society they think they are.

Their goal is to create closed communities that require their members of full devotion and fulfillment. This, for example, applies to many other people, New Acropolis. This non-profit organization is founded in Belgium in 1977, borrowing itself as the "international center of philosophy education."

During lecture cycles, it shows the most active audience and offers them the course of philosophy, which results in which the winner gets the rank of the New Acropolis member. From now on, the liabilities start: monthly fees and voluntary labor.

During the time and philosophical training, the apostrophe asks to dedicate himself to a full-time sect to respond to the New Akrate ideals. So, the formula of the "DEPES" is that you can finish the incubation. To a psychological and emotional dependency, it gives matter addiction, a gap with the professional world.

Sex violates human freedom without the apparition to leave movement. They destroy identity and family.

Before that state of affairs, our right is silent. As in Belgian and in the European level, there is no special legislation that regulates sex activity. Some measures don't protect families from sex impacts. This gap is the more harmful thing to look at in terms of the problem of child protection, whether it's teenagers who are recruiting, whether it's their children.

Let's do an example of a mother who was a fan of Angel Albert. This contortive cult prevents its members from speaking to classic medicine, rather than taking advantage of, for example, the injection of blood and blood mix... During the divorce, the mother was entrusted with child care. After five years of failed trials, my father didn't bring his mother back after visiting. In the end, he was a witness to the judgment of the court.

Today, when one of the parents belongs to a sex group, child care usually comes to a friend. But nothing guarantees the risk of kidnapping and sending children to another branch of the sect abroad.

Furthermore, this court practice has no effect when both parents are sex members.

All the dangers that sex are for individuals are justified by the fact that Parliament started a deep study to determine their causes and consequences and discussions of events that need to be affected.

In order to do this, the legislature has to provide the highest authority that is provided by the parliamentary commission of the investigation, so that he can collect all the information he needs and perform all the listening he needs.

So this is a proposal that aims to create a parliamentary inquiry that will study sex issues, its causes and influence on personality and family, as well as activities to survive.

This investigation will have all the rights defined by the Articles of 56 Constitution and the law of May 3, 1880 on parliamentary investigation.

It will perform its functions in the spirit of previous tasks based on the commission: to define general options and to prepare legislation; it will not interfere with the authority of executive or judicial authority, and will not interfere in the court of affairs, as in the issues of listening, and in the question of giving documents.

Finally, she must keep listening behind the closed door.

This commission has the following tasks: - To learn direct or indirect effects of sex in Belgium; - To study the organization and the tools that have sex at national and international levels; - to gather the thoughts of competent organs and specialized experts; - To learn the consequences of visiting a sex for a person and family; - To learn the implications of the problem when there are teenagers in sex; - and based on his work to formulate any suggestions to regulate sexual activity and protect the individual, especially disability, and family.

The Commission has to report the House of Representatives within six months after its creation. If she thinks that certain aspects of her work are confidential, she may decide not to publish them completely or partially.
