Scholasticism

Jorge Angel Livraga

Article from the Bastion bulletin, September 1981, translated from Spanish by the New Acropolis

It is not the first time that I have explained that for us Scholasticism and Organization are the two most important parts of Ideology, which, in the end, must result in Acropolis Practice. But in order to implement this new practice, we must also have a new ideology, which is unthinkable without raising our scholastic level.

How do you do that?

I will try to give you some useful tips that will help to direct the efforts, both those who learn ... by learning, and those who learn ... by teaching others. We all learn from each other and from God and nature together.

May the many years I have devoted to the Teachings be a guarantee of the efficacy of my advice.

For teachers:

1.  Even though you read the same topic year after year, do it with the same energy and enthusiasm as the first time.
    
2.  Do not allow yourself, even subconsciously, to pass on the shoulders of your students the bitterness of defeat accumulated during the years of our struggle with the imperfection of the world. Many people are in an Acropolis audience for the first time, at least at your lecture, and they are full of hope. Do not cloud the radiance of these hopes with the shadows of the past. Let the dead take care of the dead. And if you suffer, your illusions have led you to a dead end or you are overcome by doubts. Let only your pillow, your boss, or your teacher know. But never your students.
    
3.  Even those who have a good command of the lecture material should constantly improve, finding more and more new facts in order to be able to reveal all the subtleties of the topic to their interested listeners. The key points of the lecture should be perfectly mastered, and even memorized. But at the same time, each instructor should contribute to the preparation, make their efforts to adapt the lecture material to the better perception of the students of the School.
    
4.  Never forget that learning is a sacred activity, and the lecture hall is a sacred space. During training, all personal moments that affect the attitude to their students should be crossed out, and even better, torn out. If you see your students as poor and rich, white and black, male and female, then you cannot be an instructor, but rather do something else, choosing from the rich palette of opportunities offered by the New Acropolis.
    
5.  The teacher or instructor of the New Acropolis in any audience, in any situation, must keep the initiative in his hands. This rule does not mean that one should ignore one’s students, but only speaks of the need to defend scholastic discipline, as was the case with Acropolis, with the proper energy, and without ceasing to inspire the listeners. The true Master is always like a life-giving spring or spring.
    
6.  The teacher should be clear and understandable in his explanations. It is not enough to know the truth, you need to be able to explain it, bring it to consciousness, and if necessary, prove it. Remember that young people who come to the School are often disappointed in life and are looking for new ways to fulfill their ideals. We must not distort the teachings only for fear of hurting the feelings of those who are particularly resentful, because our disciples have come to us for the sake of searching for truths that are crushing and irresistible, and not for the sake of vague rhetoric that explains nothing to anyone.
    
7.  Do not expound our Teachings as if you are apologizing all the time, in an extremely quiet voice with pleading intonations, accompanied by unassuming gestures. The Acropolis instructor must always remain at the height of his position and feel himself a channel of History. We came to change the world, not to be another school of thought about esotericism. Esotericism and other similar things are only part of the Acropolis struggle, designed to inspire students. In the modern world, saturated with politicking, sectarianism, absurd fantasies, irrational fears and deliberately instilled hatred, young people are subjected to brainwashing. And if we do not oppose this ideology with something sufficiently effective and pure, so that we can rely on it without fear of slipping, our educational work will be fruitless and will not justify the hopes and efforts expended by us.
    

For students:

1.  Don’t criticize and propagate your own views, otherwise you’ll be banished to the same doors you walked through. To preserve and perpetuate our Philosophical Brotherhood, we need young men who do not want to waste their time on the follies of a declining world. We are young and strong and nothing will make us different. Take us as we are, or take other paths and walk with God. May he not leave you without support, and by his mercy you will return to Us in one of the next lives.
    
2.  The scholastic materials presented at the lectures are deliberately simplified and are the quintessence of many thousands of pages of books written on each topic. This work has been done with love and hope for your good, so be worthy of this effort. Listen carefully to your instructor, carefully study the carefully selected materials that he puts at your disposal. First you have to understand them... then you know the rest. In the process of learning, you can not jump over the steps, but you need to slowly and gradually move from one to another. This is how the Masters of Wisdom are taught, this is how We teach our disciples. This is how all Acropolis instructors should be trained.
    
3.  The discipline required of you is the foundation of spiritual growth. It is not a goal, but a means of your development.
    
4.  You can ask your instructor any questions you want, but try to make them really “questions” and not a long and confused statement of your own point of view, which is not yet mature. Dispose of your time in such a way as to be an example to the young Acropolis who follow you. Sometimes they don’t know your name yet, but like children, they look at you with faith and hope.
    
5.  Feel like a friend and ally of the instructor. He brings a lot of good things to your life, and he also needs you. You are the embodiment of his hopes.
    
6.  Do not play with Us, for in this way you play with your Destiny and waste the Love they give you here. If you do not learn to take the Sacred seriously when you are young, you will find yourself in spiritual poverty as you grow up. It is not a threat, but a warning of the operation of the Law of Nature, as inexorable as the action of gravitation or Pythagorean theorems.
    
7.  You have come to seek the truth... In that case, look for her with all your might. Look for her with perseverance and indefatigability. Don’t be quick to criticize those who walk with you. It is better to join forces with them and let your victory cry disperse the ghosts of ignorance in the corners. We believe in You, and the Acropolises of the world share your thoughts. Remember, you are not alone, and if you want to win, clench your teeth and rush forward. Immerse yourself in the Sacraments; in them lies the truth.
    

I hope that these lines will help both students and teachers to better understand their place in the New Acropolis, as well as in the history we create, filling our most precious dreams and scholastic materials.

I dedicate this article to all those who are far away from me and who I rarely see. I believe in you and your ability to achieve the Ideals of the Acropolis.
