# The founder and his contact with the "White Hierarchy"

> As announced in Nº 1 of "ALMENA", I propose to develop the theme of our relationship with the Hierarchy and of how we came into the world 24 years ago. Being I the Founder, these simple pages will acquire the value of a historical document when time passes. Faced with this evidence I find myself compelled to write something that my Personality strongly rejects, but which is necessary for the understanding of events and so that in the future there are no major distortions of the knowledge of my own Life, which could result in a distortion of the whole Work.

> With a frequency approaching bimonthly I continued to receive letters from Adyar, with advice on my readings and some exercises. At the suggestion that I would need a very private place for my studies and reflections, I conceived transforming the basement of my house at Amenábar 863 into a kind of "Crypt". The project was approved and I set myself the arduous task of removing the old remnants of wine barrels and other junk that had accumulated. I saw with surprise that the iron beams of the ceiling divided it into 7 parts, that its rectangular plan closely approximated the "auric" proportions and that it was oriented according to the 4 cardinal points. I confess that my surprise lasted little, for at that time I already had the inner certainty of working for the "Hierarchy," the "Masters of Wisdom" or whatever one wishes to call it.

> Freemasonry in its different factions and Traditional Rosicrucianism (not that of AMORC founded at the beginning of the 20th century) were attempts by the Hierarchy to rescue some Initiatory elements in the 19th century and the one that preceded it; but these attempts degenerated into highly politicized forms neutralized by Illuminist Positivism and by Marxism, born of a theoretical intellectualization of Life, the antithesis of true Traditional Esoteric Knowledge.

> (...) Then the figure of HPB appears surrounded by a pleiad of "Old" Souls that resonate before the call of the Hierarchy and the Theosophical Society is founded. Despite the initial success, this Movement also dangerously mixes with the chaotic anarchy emanating from the Dark Face of the Restoration Process.

> (...) From the Golden Branch will pass to the European continent the form called "Thule Lodge", about which there is quite a lot of information, at least exoteric, and which would give impetus and justification to the political movement that we usually group under the name "Nazism", with its prologues and its epilogues.

> (...) I, past my 20 years (the age at which I began to write ANKOR), began my work in the Amenábar basement converted into an Egyptian Ritual Crypt and continued to receive, now from Sri Ram, some letters from Adyar and apparently very old photocopies and carbon copies that always bore as sender "Madras 20 th". (...) He visited the Crypt and approved it, but to me it seemed with little enthusiasm. But an inner Will, which fortunately did not abandon me throughout my life, made me continue by my own drive, beyond approvals that my youth would have wished to be more enthusiastic. The first two years of the Crypt led me to develop the possibility of contacting my unknown Masters more directly.

> From Master A. I learned the harmonic relationships of all that is to be manifested harmonically. From Master Aa. to dive into past incarnations with a minimum of distortion from the superposition of images and experiences. From Master M. (indirectly) to seek the truth without useless detours and to impose the will over the passions. From Master K.H. (indirectly) to understand the mission of the New Man and the 6th Subrace.

> I want to clarify, first of all, that there are Decrees that force all National Structures to a minimum growth... but NEVER has a maximum growth been decreed. (...). I have referred several times to the fact that, insofar as we can know, the Hierarchy attempts a form of Movement that does not burn out in a few years nor mutate or transform and that can continue with the same tone beyond the physical life of its Founder.

> Closer than anything metaphysical and ontological, there exists in Nature a mechanics of existence that is reflected in events and in Being-in-itself. He who knows these laws of historical mechanics does not need to "prophesy" to discover new directions several decades and even centuries in advance (...). It is also good to consider a mechanics of emotions and feelings that will form the driving engines to set the Hierarchy's Plans in motion... so that the preconceived program enters into a life cycle.
