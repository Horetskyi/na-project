# The founder and his contact with the "White Hierarchy"

> As announced in No. 1 of "ALMENA," I intend to develop the theme of our relationship with Hierarchy and how we came to the world 24 years ago. Being the Founder, these simple pages will acquire historical document value when time passes. In the face of this evidence I am compelled to write something that my Personality strongly rejects, but which is necessary for the understanding of events and for there to be no important deformations of the knowledge of my own Life in the future, which could have an impact on a deformation of the whole Work.

> With a frequency approaching the bimonthly he continued to receive letters from Adyar, with advice on my readings and with some exercises. Given the suggestion that I would need a very private place for my studies and reflections, I conceived to transform the basement of my house in Amenabar 863 into a form of "Crypta." The project was approved and I dedicated myself to the vigorous task of getting the old remains of wine tonels and other things that had accumulated. I saw with surprise that the iron beams of the ceiling divided it into 7 parts, that its rectangular plant was very close to the "auric" proportions and that it was oriented according to the 4 cardinal points. I confess that my surprise lasted little, for at that time I had the internal assurance of being working for "Hierarchy," the "Masters of Wisdom" or whatever it is called.

> The Masonry in its different factions and the Traditional Rosacrucism (not that of AMORC founded in the early 20th century) were attempts of the Hierarchy to rescue some Elements of Initiatory cut in the 19th century and in which it preceded it; but these attempts degenerated in highly politicized and neutralized forms by the Illuminist Positivism and Marxism, born of a theoretical intellect of Life, the antithesis of true Traditional Ethermal Knowledge.

> (...) The figure of HPB appears then surrounded by a pleade of "Old" Souls that resonate before the claim of Hierarchy and the Theosophical S. is founded. Despite the initial success, this Movement also dangerously blends with the chaotic anarchy emanating from the Dark Face of the Restoration Process.

> (...) De la Rama Dorada will pass to the European continent the form called "Logia Thule" of which there is a lot of information, at least exoteric, and that would give impetus and justification to the political movement that we usually include in the name of "Nazism," with its prologos and its epitlogos.

> (...) I, over the 20 years old (when I started writing ANKOR), started my work in the Amenabar basement turned into Egyptian Ritual Crypta and continued to receive, now from Sri Ram, some letters from Adyar and apparently very old carbonic photocopies and copies that were always carried as sender "Madras 20 th." (...) He visited the Crypta and approved it, but it seemed to me with little enthusiasm. But an internal Will, which fortunately did not leave me in all my life, made me follow with my own engine, beyond approvals that my youth would have wanted them to be more enthusiastic. The first two years of Cripta led me to develop the possibility of contacting more directly my unknown Masters.

> From Master A. I learned the harmonic relationships of all that is to be manifested harmonically. From Master A. to dive in past incarnations with a minimum of distortion by superposition of images and experiences. From Master M. (indirect) to seek the truth without turning futile and to impose the will on the passions. From Master K.H. (indirect) to understand the mission of the New Man and the 6th Subraza.

> I want to make it clear, first of all, that there are Decrees that force all the National Structures to a minimum growth... but JAMIS has decreed a maximum growth. (...). I have referred several times to the fact that, within what we can know, the Hierarchy tries a form of Movement that does not burn in a few years or move or transform and that it can continue with the same tonic beyond the physical life of its Founder.

> More here than anything metaphysical and ontological, there is in Nature a mechanics of existence that is reflected in events and existence--in-yes. He who knows these laws of historical mechanics does not need to "prophesy" to discover the new paths in advance of several lusts and even centuries (...). It is also good to consider a mechanics of emotions and feelings that will form the start-up engines of the Hierarchy Plans... so that the pre-thought program will enter into a life cycle.
