## Note from blog administrators:

The term Kama- manas refers to the "rational mind." It's the mind that you track and analyze things in a concrete way. Then there would be another kind of mind called "Manas," which corresponds to the "spiritual mind," which is able to capture things more intuitively. Knowledge belongs to "Kama-Manas," while Wisdom belongs to "Manas."

## RECOPILATION OF CITAS:

The Acropolitan must know how to silence his Kama- manas and clean himself from those feminoid elements (in the worst sense of the word) that precipitate him into the arms of subconscious animality; of the spirit of escape, of turning his back on life and of being kidnapped by the Dark Forces. You must avoid that kind of psychic rape so that they are not born, then, within your astral and mental body, the elemental larvae that will resound the Soul.

Maintain and recover, if lost, the basic level of discipline. Maintain activities that promote strength in hearts and sacrifice capacity. The dialogue with the Kamamanas is not the same as Ladies or Gentlemen.

We must avoid the psychological trap of "Kama- manas" to feel the time dedicated to New Acropolis as something "torn away" in our lives. The truth is just the opposite; the only useful hours of our present incarnation are those dedicated to the Ideal. Everything else is dust that the wind of life is in charge of spreading.

Bastion No. 63-3: How to use time. May 1982. Jorge ﾃ］gel Livraga For the hundredth time, we repeat: a poor theological concept is better than the most elaborate of materialist doctrines. In the long run, a man who believes in God, who conceives him as he wants, will be stronger and more resistant than a thousand men who deny him. Thus, New Acropolis will live as long as it is spiritual and at least will keep alive a spark of the Mystic flame of the Mysteries.
