## Note from blog administrators: 

The term Kama-manas refers to the "rational mind". It is the mind that reasons and analyzes things in a concrete way. Then there would be another kind of mind called "Manas", which corresponds to the "spiritual mind", which is able to grasp things more intuitively. Knowledge belongs to "Kama-Manas", while Wisdom belongs to "Manas". 

## COMPILATION OF QUOTES:

The acropolitan must know how to silence his Kama-manas and cleanse himself of those feminoid elements (in the worst sense of the word) that plunge him into the arms of subconscious animality; of the spirit of flight, of turning his back on life and of allowing himself to be seized by the Dark Forces. He must avoid that sort of psychic violation so that, later, elemental larvae do not arise within his astral and mental body and dry up the Soul.

Maintain and recover, if it has been lost, the basic level of discipline. Maintain activities that promote strength in the hearts and the capacity for sacrifice. The dialogue with the Kama-manas is not fitting for Ladies or Gentlemen. 

Command nº 59. It is essential to maintain cohesion. Jorge Ángel Livraga

We must avoid the psychological trap laid by "Kama-manas" of feeling the time dedicated to New Acropolis as something "ripped away" from our lives. The truth is precisely the opposite; the only useful hours of our present incarnation are those dedicated to the Ideal. Everything else is dust that the wind of life takes care of scattering. 

Bastion Nº 63-3: On how to make use of time. May 1982. Jorge Ángel Livraga
For the umpteenth time, we repeat: a poor theological concept is better than the most elaborate of materialist doctrines. In the long run, a man who believes in God, who conceives him as he wishes, will be stronger and more resilient than a thousand men who deny him. Thus, New Acropolis will live as long as it is spiritual and will at least keep alive a spark of the Mystical flame of the Mysteries.
